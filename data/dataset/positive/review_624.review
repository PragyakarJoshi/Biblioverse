     I thought I'd post brief reviews of some good films I've seen recently on video.  (The release dates I've given are approximate, by the way.) HOUSEKEEPING (1989) ****   A Bill Forsyth film, this is a touching, amusing story of two orphaned girls    who come under the supervision of their eccentric Aunt.  Beautiful   cinematography and great performances by the leads, esp. Christine Lahti. THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY (1979) ****   Gripping, complex British gangster movie, with great work by Bob Hoskins    and Helen Mirren in the leads.  Warning: those who have trouble understanding   heavy accents (particularly Cockney) may want to avoid this film. MIRACLE MILE (1989) ****   A sleeper from last year, this story mixes romance, suspense and the threat   of nuclear war in a very different, very engrossing film.  (To tell more   would spoil too much of the plot.)  Stars Anthony Edwards and Mare Winningham. MR. NORTH (1989) ***   One of the last films produced by John Huston, this is the film version   of a Thornton Wilder story (if I remember right).  It tells the story of   Mr. T. Theophilus North, an engaging young man with some unconventional    ideas and a peculiar physical ability to store static electricity.  Despite    the good performances and an interesting setting (ritzy Rhode Island during    the 20's or 30's), the story on this one never really drew me in.  I can only   recommend it to fans of the period and the people involved.  Stars Anthony    Edwards, Robert Mitchum, Tammy Grimes, Virginia Madsen, Anjelica Huston,    Harry Dean Stanton and others. HOW TO GET AHEAD IN ADVERTISING (1989) ****   A very weird, very funny comedy about the tribulations of a British Ad   exec who just can't figure out how to sell a new acne cream.  The stress   gives him a problem that makes the average case of pimples seem desirable.   Wonderful performances by the leads none of whom I knew except for Rachel   Ward who has quite overcome her early typecasting. THE LION IN WINTER (1967) *****   A classic that tells the story of "family ups and downs" on Christmas    day 1183 in the household of King Henry II of Britain.  An enthralling    character study, this film has incredible performances by Peter O'Toole    and Katharine Hepburn, with solid support from Anthony Hopkins, Timothy    Dalton and others.  This film has probably the overall best dialogue of    any movie I have every seen, so good that I watched it twice in a row just    to try to remember some of it.  Hepburn deservedly won an Oscar for her    performance.  If you haven't seen this film, by all means try to do so. PRICK UP YOUR EARS (1988) ****   A solid British drama, this film describes the tragic relationship between    playwright Joe Orton and his lover, Kenneth Halliwell.  The film   covers Orton's rise to success and the emotional struggles of Halliwell    to adjust from his early start as Orton's mentor to his later role as    Orton's "personal assistant."  Very well acted by Gary Oldman, Alfred   Molina and Vanessa Redgrave.  (Note: the film may bother those who have    a problem with an open depiction of homosexual relationships.) PASCALI'S ISLAND (1989) ****   Set just before WWI, this film tells the story of Basil Pascali, a "local    character" on a Turkish-governed Greek island.  Basil makes a meager living    on the island as an interpreter and government intermediary for residents    and tourists.  Basil is also a "career informer" for the Turkish Imperial    government, and has been sending secret reports for the last 20 years.  The   film details a sequence of events that may either expose Basil or allow him    to leave a life that has lost meaning for him.  Ben Kingsley (one of my    favorite actors) is excellent as Basil, Charles Dance does a fine job as the    archaeologist, and Helen Mirren is very good as Basil's best friend.
