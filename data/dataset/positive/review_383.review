Since this is a David Mamet film (he directed it, and wrote the screenplay with Shel Silverstein), you can count on several things: 1)  Certain actors will be present, from Mamet's own personal stable of     personal favorites: in this case, Joe Montagna and Robert Prosky.  Don     Ameche is a newcomer to Mamet plays/films, and shares center stage with     Montagna, and both do a beautiful job. 2)  Everyone talks in a kind of rhythmic manner -- the phrases and words     spin and loop some.  No, people don't talk like that in real life, but     that's why Mamet wins awards -- they sound, well, right. 3)  God help you if you're trying to predict what's going to happen in this     film.  I didn't have a clue, and that was the best part of the film;     THINGS CHANGE generates curiosity and suspense, as well as laughter,     melancholy and drama. With that, I *really* do not want to say much about the film; I'd prefer for you to go in as virgins to the story.  Let's just say that it's about an old shoe-shiner, a mob flunky on probation, Reno, and an interesting bunch of mob personnel that Ameche and Mantegna get mixed up in.  Oh, it also has a moral. I think.
