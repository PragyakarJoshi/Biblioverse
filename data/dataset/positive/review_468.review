     Through the years, Blake Edwards has made some outrageously funny films. Remember all the Pink Panther movies?  More recently he has also made some very funny films like S.O.B., 10 and VICTOR/VICTORIA.      His latest directorial effort is entitled SKIN DEEP.  This is a film about a married, successful writer and musician (John Ritter), who decides to engage in the art of infidelity.  This new hobby of his succeeds until his wife  unexpectedly catches him fooling around.  He soon gets ousted from his happy home.  He is later seen explaining all of his female encounters to his psychiatrist.      This motion picture features Vincent Gardenia (MOONSTRUCK) as his friend. It also features Julianne Phillips (the former Mrs. Bruce Springsteen) and Denise Crosby as two of his female conquests.  He soon learns the meaning to the saying "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."      This film simply stated is a light romantic comedy.  It is not really Blake Edwards' best work, but it does contain a few funny moments.  This advertisement for this film promotes a scene that they say is too sexy to be mentioned on television.  Well, it is too sexy for me to mention it here either.  All I can say is that it is probably the funniest scene in the movie.
