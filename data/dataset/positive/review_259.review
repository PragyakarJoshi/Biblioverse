     Well, on the fast-moving satirical scale of film, this isn't up to AIRPLANE!, but is about halfway between it and TOP SECRET! -- which I liked fairly well, so this is a definite thumbs-up.  Lots of fast-moving jokes, but perhaps the best point is that the film gets funnier, instead of running out of steam, as it progresses.  It keeps the pace, and that is a rarity in so many of these films.  I was grinning through all of it, and laughing through many of the gags; about the only film that I have ever laughed continuously through is MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL.     Tons of Meta-humor, including one running joke about financial problems     which gets funnier and funnier as it goes.     No "Killing Joke", i.e. gag that you carry out of the theater     remembering for years to come.  With a Killing Joke, you don't see the     joke, think about it and laugh (all in a nano-second, unless you're     Jesse Helms) -- you see it and then black out from laughing.  Totally     unexpected -- there's no middleman 'twixt the screen and the brain. The     rear-collision Pinto gag in TOP SECRET! is a classic of that genre,     though not up (by any means) to the Python films (the absolute pinnacle     of Killing Joke humor is the bit in HOLY GRAIL where Arthur sends a     knight down to dispatch the stuffed rabbit -- and then it leaps for the     knight's throat and rips his head off.  Everything went black for me     when I first saw the film...).  But very constant humor.     John Astin is probably the only actor who can be endearing while     cackling inanely for two hours.     The film's low-budget works for it, not against it, and you feel almost     parental towards it.  Some of the actors from the previous film ham it     up just a too much (the parachute gag got old long before this), but I     can live with it.     Besides, it sports Karen Mistal, the most finest-looking woman ever to     grace The Fox Television Network, in a prominent role (and her eyes     glow red!  Keen!).  Imagine the girl you had puppy love for in high     school crossed with a Norwegian sex goddess and you get the idea.  Oh,     callow youth. A definite success -- solid $4.50 film.
