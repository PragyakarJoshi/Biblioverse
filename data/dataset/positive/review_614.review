     FAMILY BUSINESS stars Sean Connery as an elderly burglar in New York. Dustin Hoffman appears as his estranged son, Dustin Hoffman, and Matthew  Broderick as *his* son.      The dynamics of the film are complicated.  Suffice it to say that Connery's character is a professional burglar.  Hoffman's used to be one as well, but  gave it up, in favor of "legitimate" business.  There is a conflict between  father and son.  Broderick is portrayed as a smart kid who mysteriously  drops out of a master's degree program--to "join the family business."  His father isn't very happy about that, but his grandfather is supportive.  The rest of the movie deals with a caper and the various conflicts among the three men.      This is a relatively serious movie, with good characterizations all around.  It's the first "serious" film Connery's been in in a LONG time (he tends to favor action/adventure films, which he invariably shines in). Broderick is surprisingly good as the grandson.  Hoffman's well, Hoffman. Everyone has a nasty side to himself: this isn't a gooey-feel-good Christmas movie.      Don't get the impression that this is another THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY. (which was also a good movie)  It isn't.
