     The other day I rented Brian DePalma's 1986 organized crime comedy WISE GUYS.  It was worse than this DePalma fan thought a DePalma film could be.  So it was with some trepidation that I went to see yet another Mafia-style buddy film: MIDNIGHT RUN.  Perhaps the contrast accounts for why I so thoroughly enjoyed the latter.      There is nothing particularly new about pitting two opposites against each other, having a cross-country chase, or dodging the FBI and the mob.  MIDNIGHT RUN transcends the formula with a well-crafted script and terrific acting on the parts of the lead characters.  I was never a big fan of Charles Grodin until I saw him hold his own with Robert DeNiro.  The chemistry between these two actors really works, and they are so compelling that they practically carry the film.  Fortunately they are backed up by a fine supporting cast featuring some of the dumbest and meanest mobsters ever, with Dennis Farina as the latter.  Yaphet Koto gets in some good licks as the harried FBI special agent.      Martin Brest also gets credit for his taught direction.  This film is a real balancing act between comedy, drama, and action picture.  Just when things might tip too far in one direction everything comes swinging back.  And, as Steve Upstill pointed out at the theatre, there are at least four times during the film where you ask yourself "How on *earth* will they get out of this one?"  As outlandish as the answer often is, the film works well enough to let you willingly suspend disbelief.      MIDNIGHT RUN is certainly worth seeing, and it's actually worth seeing on the big screen, the better to appreciate Rob Hahn's fine camera operation.
