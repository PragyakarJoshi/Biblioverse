     This is not an adolescent action film.  It is an adult "courtroom drama." Films about sanity have been popular topics from THE KING OF HEARTS to ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST.  Streisand and Dreyfus star in this one with a cast of other well-known actors and actresses and one unexpected appearance.      Karl Malden has an interesting role playing Streisand's step-father.  Look for caricature drawings (the Nose and American Express).  His character is pivotal (but almost predictable) in the film.      The drama centers around Streisand who is accused of manslaughter ("womanslaughter" in her terms a la the ads).  This is not her felony trial but a hearing to determine sanity and competence to stand on such a trial.  Dreyfus is her count-appointed lawyer after Streisand breaks the nose of her parent-appointed lawyer.  Every character fears from this event that she just may be "Nuts."      NUTS is about conduct and how individuals are expected to behave in our confusing society.  It is an appropriate film in an age considering drug-testing and questions of sanity.      Two interesting scenes are 1) a scene between Streisand and Dreyfus regarding privacy and a need-to-know and 2) the cross-examination of Streisand.      The film's real weaknesses are in the forms of flashbacks used to fill the audience in.  This is a performance film, not so much a story.  There are elements of this film which remind the reviewer of Nicholson's ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST performance.  If this film had been made in the early 70s, it might have had a different conclusion.      If you think you are the slightest bit crazy, go see this film; otherwise, skip it.      B movie (90 minutes before I checked a watch).  I found it personally enjoyable. --eugene miya NASA Ames Research Center <A HREF="mailto:eugene@ames-aurora.ARPA">eugene@ames-aurora.ARPA</A>   {hplabs,hao,ihnp4,decwrl,allegra,tektronix}!ames!aurora!eugene
