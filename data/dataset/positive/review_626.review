     While there are a few missteps in the movie, the acting is superb.  I never really considered Tom Cruise an actor until I saw this film.  Oliver Stone continues building on his reputation as a director who creates visceral, gut-wrenching movies.  An 8 or 9 on the Chuck scale.      BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY is the true story of Ron Kovic, a rabble-rousing Viet Nam paraplegic and how he got that way.  The film opens idyllically in the late '50s, when little Ronny Kovic is playing soldiers with his friends.  The action switches to the 4th of July parade, where we meet Ronny's ever-growing family, and Donna, the girl who'll break his heart eventually.  The scenes of Massapequa, New York are scenes of a safe home, where the greatest danger is Mom finding a Playboy in teenaged Ronny's room.      As a teenager, Ronny is a driven idealist who goes into the Marines right after graduation.  The action jumps ahead three years, and we see Sargeant Kovic, an almost-hardened soldier.  Almost immediately, there's shooting and death, and within fifteen minutes of the film's arrival in Vietnam, there's the awful scene of Ron Kovic going down fighting, followed by five minutes of hell in the field hospital.  I couldn't watch most of the field hospital sequences; it was some of the most gruesome stuff I'd ever seen.  But it was never gratuitous.  The audience is as numbed by the gore as Ron Kovic was.      The next sequences in the Bronx VA hospital are so outrageous that they can only be true.  Kovic pushes himself, and pushes some more, and eventually is forced to realize that he'll never walk again.  He never really accepts that, or his experiences in Vietnam, and sinks into alcoholism after he returns home to Massapequa.      A lot goes on in the 2-1/2-hour running time of this movie.  His conversion to a militant pacifist and vet against the war happens pretty quickly near the end of the movie.  But Tom Cruise really makes us believe that Ron Kovic spent the first few years of his physical paralysis as a sort of emotional spastic.  A person who let the world go on so long as he could drink, and would only occasionally let the rage show.      The supporting cast, particularly the actors who play Kovic's parents, are all fine.  Willem Dafoe has a great turn as a drugged-out paraplegic Kovic meets in Mexico. 2.  Vietnam looked too much like Mexico.  That's because Stone shot         the Vietnam portions in Mexico.  Then he chose almost IDENTICAL         opening shots (incredibly yellow aerial shots of sand dunes) to         establish both locales (Kovic goes to Mexico for some R&R). 4.  Same problem with Donna.  The movie strongly implies that she's         gotten married, and she introduces Kovic to anti-war protests.         She also completely disappears from the movie. 6. The movie could have been trimmed by about another five minutes with         no damage done, particularly the murky scene after the very         dramatic disruption of the Republican National Convention. /*I'm a woman by nature, a mother by choice.  ** Capitalist for choice!
