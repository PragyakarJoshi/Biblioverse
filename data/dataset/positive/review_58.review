          Capsule review:  Ugly, unpleasant urban horror film      about a voodoo-like religion in New York City.  There is      nothing original or creative and little enjoyable in the      film.  If John Schlesinger can make films like MIDNIGHT      COWBOY, that's really what he should be doing.      There hasn't been a horror film like THE BELIEVERS in a while.  After ROSEMARY'S BABY, and especially after THE EXORCIST, there were several horror films in modern--particularly urban--settings.  To make a film seem more believable and immediate, it was set in a contemporary city setting. THE SENTINEL worked that way; so did THE WOLFEN.  There was even a weekly "urban horror" TV series, KOLCHAK: THE NIGHTSTALKER.  Then along came Stephen King, who usually uses small towns for his settings.  Consciously or not, film producers followed suit.  Setting is, of course, only one of many factors in what makes a horror film, but it does a lot to set the tone, and THE BELIEVERS somehow feels like a throwback to the NIGHTSTALKER series sort of horror story with definite echoes of ROSEMARY'S BABY and BURN WITCH BURN.      An African-based religion, Santeria, is creeping into New York City. Santeria is voodoo-like and calls for blood sacrifices of chickens and other small animals.  It may also call for human sacrifice.  There have been bodies of young boys found who appear to have been sacrificed in a brutal manner.  When a policeman is suspected of taking part in Santerian ceremonies, Martin Sheen, a police psychologist, is called in.  Sheen becomes involved in the investigation of the murders.      THE BELIEVERS does something quite difficult.  In spite of a muddled and confusing plot, it is predictable.  Just about every surprise in the film telegraphs itself well in advance.  There is almost nothing original or inventive in the entire film.  Most of the horror impact of the film comes from scenes of mutilated animals.  There is one effective makeup effect which produces as much nausea as fear in the audience.      Director John Schlesinger had previously done films like BILLY LIAR, DARLING, FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD, MIDNIGHT COWBOY, DAY OF THE LOCUST, and MARATHON MAN.  These are not schlock films!  Schlesinger can make very good films.  MARATHON MAN shows that he can do very good suspense films. However, my advice to him would be that less talented directors than him can do a better job with horror; few can make a MIDNIGHT COWBOY or even a MARATHON MAN.  He should make films but stay away from horror.  Rate THE BELIEVERS a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale.
