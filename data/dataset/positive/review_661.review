          CAPSULE:  Not really a sequel, but another film using the same      clever basis as its predecessor.  A Bushman's children are carried      away in a truck, which they have never seen before.  He follows the      tracks, hoping to find them.  Along his way, he encounters a      biologist, a lost lawyer, poachers and soldiers.  A very funny film      with a mild philosophical lesson.  Suitable for everyone.      Following the rule that a sequel must stand on its own, Part Two can be seen by anyone, whether they saw the original or not.  The producers clearly knew they had a winning formula, and so (mercifully) not one thing has changed about how the story is told.  The production values are much higher this time, which is a plus.  The humor, acting and scenery are virtually identical to the first film.  That is, there is a droll narrator, some slapstick, a man and a woman, lots and lots of funny one liners, and interesting and funny animals (with one creature I cannot identify being entitled to an Oscar for best supporting beast).      The only returning character is Xixo (KEE-ko), played once again by N!xua (I think the ! is a clucking sound made with the tongue; used in the Bushman language, apparently).  But the formula is identical.  It would be pointless to summarize the plot beyond what is said in the capsule; the story really isn't important.  The point of the film is to show the silliness more "advanced" society can achieve, by comparing its members to Xixo and his simpler ways. But, the message is very gently delivered, and even the most staunch conservatives (like me) will not be put off.
