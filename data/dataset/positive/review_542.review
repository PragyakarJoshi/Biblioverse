     Okay, Cinema Philosophy Time:  Can a film with an abysmal script, unremarkable photography, reams of shoot-outs and chase scenes, wind-up villains, outrageous plot blunders, gratuitous advertising (how many Subway Shops can *you* spot in this picture?) and a totally predictable climax be saved by a good rapport between the two main characters, and a basis for said relationship that overshadows the pedestrian film?      I mean, I like watching Gibson and Glover when they get together.  I particularly like the concept for their relationship: Gibson plays a cop who is right on -- I mean *right* on -- the edge; he's a finely-honed, somewhat demented (at least in risk-taking) fighter.  However, he would have burned himself out (or killed himself) long ago, if it weren't for his friends, i.e. his partner (Danny Glover) and his partner's family, who've adopted him and given him that lifeline that anchors him to reality.  Their affection for him, and his for them, works.  Unfortunately, that constitutes about 15% of the movie.  The rest of it has to be one of the lamest excuses for an action film since FATAL BEAUTY.      Oh, Lord, where to start?  The villains are drug-dealers, sadists *and* racist South African officials.  (I'll bet the head honcho was originally Joseph Goebbels, Jr., but they decided to cut that bit out to save running time for the action sequences.)  What these people are able to get away with under the aegis of Diplomatic Immunity is unbelievable.  (Even under the Bush administration.  Hell, even under the Quayle administration.)  Characters are introduced and then killed left and right to get G & G (and the audience) into the "Waste Their Ass" mood -- it's pretty transparent.  And if that wasn't enough, the main henchman comes out of the blue to say that he killed Gibson's character's wife before LETHAL WEAPON!  Gee, why not have him responsible for shooting down Korean Airlines Flight 007, or spitting on Jesus -- *really* give Mel that excuse to Waste His Ass!      Good points, besides the chemistry between The Guys?  Neat nail gun. (Craftsman?)  The girl looks like Susan Dey with her own Wolfe tanning system. And there are a few good lines.  Not enough to sustain the movie, though.      My suggestion: see THE ABYSS.  It isn't a masterpiece, but I can still remember what happened in it.  LETHAL WEAPON II has sort of faded from my memory -- no doubt some sort of natural protection mechanism.
