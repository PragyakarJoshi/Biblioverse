     RUNNING ON EMPTY is one of the best films released this year, an excellent family drama with strong performances by Judd Hirsh, Christine Lahti, and River Phoenix.      The story involves a family on the run from the law.  In the early 1970s Art and Annie Pope (Judd Hirsch and Christine Lahti) blew up a napalm laboratory as part of the anti-war movement.  The explosion inadvertently blinded and paralyzed a janitor.  The FBI has been on their tracks for years, as the  Popes frequently have to move from town to town changing their identities wherever they go.      The movie is not so much a chase story with the Popes running from the law, but rather deals with the Popes' fugitive life style and the effect it has on their two sons.  Danny Pope (River Phoenix) is a 17-year-old coming into manhood feeling a conflict between his own desires and the protection and safety of his parents.  Danny is a talented musician who is "discovered" by a local high school teacher, and also falls in love with the teacher's daughter. As Danny's musical reputation as a  young prodigy spreads through the town, a conflict develops because of the desire of his parents to maintain their anonymity without stunting Danny's growth.        The film deals with the age-old struggle of becoming your own person in conflict with what your family would like you to be.  The actors are very  believable in their roles, and the film has an emotional intensity that caused  quite a few tears in the audience I was in.        The movie also touches on the values of the 60's generation in conflict with the traditional views of that time, and how the 60's generation have to deal with similar conflicts with the children of their own.  One powerful scene where Annie Pope meets her father after 15 years of absence is worth the price of admission to the film.      The story starts off slow and takes some time to get going, but if you stick with it, RUNNING ON EMPTY will really capture your attention.  I would give it a +3 on a -4 to +4 scale.
