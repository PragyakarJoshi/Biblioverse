     (This is a Francis Ford Coppola presentation, produced and directed by Godfrey Reggio, music by Philip Glass, cinematography by Ron Fricke.)      This film is a visually dazzling, audio-inspiring, vaguely anti-war statement.  It is pretty transparent, and I knew we were in trouble about 10 minutes into this film when it switched from beautiful nature landscapes to big, ugly man-made machines.      So, the director chose to portray man in an essentially negative light. No one is happy in this film.  Lots of H-bombs blow up in between the pretty pictures of time-lapse photography.      At the very end, when the credits are finished, we find out it is "An Ire Production".  Tsk, tsk.  There's little quite so irritating as video morality and video political left-wing leanings.      Also, it falls into the Lucas-trap of edits that are so fast, one hardly has a chance to choose to accept or reject the images being flooded into the audience's mind.  In this respect, it is a film meant for non-thinkers.
