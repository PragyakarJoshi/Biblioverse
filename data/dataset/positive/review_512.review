     Timothy Dalton's back as James Bond, in what appears to be a mixture of many plot elements from the *book* LIVE AND LET DIE, the movie THUNDERBALL, and various "Miami Vice" episodes.      The plot: Tragedy strikes Felix Leiter, the CIA agent who's helped out Bond many a time (and who's undergone yet another facelift :-)).  The culprit is a drug czar.  Bond goes on a revenge trip, accumulating an impressive body  count along the way (remember, Bond has the license to *kill*, and he uses it  liberally in this one).  In the process of his vendetta, the Secret Service  disowns him, which makes for a renegade secret agent, and, for the first time in the series' history, a plausible cover story.      Story: mostly sound, almost even believable.      Dialogue: I saw this at a college preview.  The audience appreciated some intentionally corny lines.  I'm not sure how well the same lines would come across in "real life."  "I love James so much"--this from a girl who barely knows him...  :-)  (That particular scene was a throw-away.)  There are a lot of very good wisecracks, as well as self-deprecating humor.      Special effects: some pretty good ones, some very complex.  Unfortunately, there are continuity problems on some of the more complex effects.      Stunts: likewise, some very complex ones....      Gore count: still cartoonland violence, but this flick has the highest  casualty count in years.      Characterization: Bond's drifting closer to the "book Bond" than even Connery did.  He gets really bashed up in this one (although, unlike many a Bond book, he doesn't end up in the hospital).  The villain's a suitable match for him,  this time around.      Product placement: didn't seem very conspicuous.  Of course, a Coast Guard Dauphin II had a big "Aerospatiale" logo on the side of it, which I didn't notice when I examined one fairly closely six weeks ago.... :-)        Gadgets: a few.  I get the impression that the gadgets were only introduced to bring Q on the screen, who's an audience favorite.  It isn't really a gadget movie, but they do use everyday household appliances (spear  guns, lighters, airplanes, Stingers) in interesting ways...      Overall review: one of the best adventure films this summer, and the best Bond since THE SPY WHO LOVED ME.  Easily on a par with INDY III, and much better than the summer disappointments (GHOSTBUSTERS II, STAR TREK V, BATMAN). 3 stars (out of four), or a 7.5/10 on the genre-sensitive scale.
