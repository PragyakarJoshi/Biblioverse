     What is the nicest thing I can think of to say about NEAR DARK?  Well, they didn't bend too much the traditional rules for vampires and within those rules they showed something of how dangerous a gang of really mean- spirited (bloody-minded?) vampires might be.  Beyond that, NEAR DARK is over three hours in a film so bad, every minute of watching it counts as two minutes off your sentence.      A guy picks up a girl who turns out to be a vampire.  She bites him after what seems like and interminable period of time.  This opening sequence turns out to be the high point of the film.  Our friend is forced to join the gang of vampires to learn the trade of vampirism.  Mostly he sees how the vampires bully and terrorize humans with their powers.  The scenes of the bullying are long and violent and bloody and boring.  There are a couple of ideas borrowed from Anne Rice's INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE.
