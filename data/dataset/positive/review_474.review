RED SCORPION (R - violence, language)      Dolph (ROCKY IV, MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE) Lundgren stars as Nicolai, the most respected and dangerous member of a super-elite Soviet military special forces group.  Nicolai is ordered to end a growing rebellion in Soviet and Cuban controlled Africa.  His mission is to befriend a captured member of the African rebellion and use that friendship to gain entry into the rebels' main camp.  As soon as Nicolai is trusted and in the camp, he is to assassinate their leader.        The movie centers around Nicolai's struggle with his orders.  At first, he is an unwavering soldier acting not on what he feels but on what he is told. But he soon develops a growing resistance to the sanctity of his orders, and finally a disgust for the Soviet and Cuban oppression in Africa.        Lundgren gives a respectable performance as Nicolai, making much of the movie seem believable.  It is this performance that makes the movie worthwhile. Removing Nicolai's personal struggle would reduce the quality and interest of this film significantly.  But, Lundgren does portray a very human and interesting character.  Of particular interest is his interaction with and old African bushmen.  Without the benefits of a common language, these two develop a unique bond between each another that provides the most memorable sequence in the film.        But don't get too excited, this movie could have been better.   It was unbelievable in a few parts, and technically poor in others.   However, considering the budget and targeted audience, this movie reaches its goals.  It is an entertaining and interesting film that, although somewhat predictable, manages to interject little pieces of human nature into the somewhat tired and worn subject of weak rebels led by a strong outsider against a common foe.  If you like this type of movie, you will probably enjoy this film.
