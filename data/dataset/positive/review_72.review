     INNER SPACE, the latest release produced by Steven Spielberg, is a fun two-hour romp with the same flair that made BACK TO THE FUTURE such a hit.  The story involves a top-secret military project to inject a miniaturized pilot and his high-tech submarine into the blood stream of a rabbit.  Unfortunately, the bad guys find out about the project, and raid the laboratory just before the experiment is to take place.  A scientist flees with the miniaturized sub in a syringe, and injects it into a unsuspecting nerdy pedestrian in a nearby shopping mall.  Soon  the nerd hears a little voice in his ear telling him what is going on; he is horrified to learn that he must retrieve a stolen computer chip from the bad guys in order to get the sub inside of him removed and reenlarged back to normal size.      As with his other films, Spielburg borrows concepts from films in the past and combines them to make an entertaining movie.  The innocent bystander suddenly involved in political intrigue is pure Hitchcock, the shots of the tiny sub in the body are reminiscent of FANTASTIC VOYAGE, the high-tech sub and the situations it gets the nerd into remind me of BACK TO THE FUTURE, and the mad-cap chase scenes are similar to ROMANCING THE STONE.  The mood is definitely light and there are numerous well-done sight gags (though at times the humor gets a little silly).      If you want a good laugh, and can refrain from thinking too hard, go see INNER SPACE.  The sneak preview audience I was in thoroughly enjoyed it.
