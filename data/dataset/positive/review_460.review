* Sometimes listed as NOSFERATU THE VAMPIRE Synopsis:      Very classy and stylish version of the Dracula story. A remake of the classic 1927 film by F.W. Murnau, NOSFERATU. Of interest to fans of vampire movies. Germany (German with English subtitles), color, 1979. Director: Werner Herzog Principal cast: Klaus Kinski, Isabelle Adjani, Bruno Ganz      There is no need to detail the plot of this film, other than to say that it is a very well made version of the classic novel, DRACULA, by Bram Stoker. Klaus Kinski stars as the evil ghoul, Count Dracula.  Kinski's Dracula has a shaved head, and he wears white make-up for a distinct "ghoulish" appearance.      According to the information available to me, the film follows the original novel storyline very closely.  As such, it may interest individuals who liked the book, but not the numerous film versions that modify the story ("rewrite" might be a more accurate description for many of the Dracula films). The film has a "gothic feel," and is very well done.  There is very careful attention to detail, and the film was shot on location in Eastern Europe.      One attraction of the film is its music, done by the German group Popol Vuh (Florian Fricke, Daniel Fichelser).  Their music falls into the category that is now called "new age," although Popol Vuh began in 1971 as part of the early German electronic music scene.      The acting is excellent, although it may be a bit understated.  Kinski's Dracula comes across as a very strange recluse, rather than the flamboyant, arrogant persona evident in other Dracula films.  This makes the story more "believable."      This film is a staple at many repertory theatres.  Some theaters screen it several times a year, usually pairing it with more recent vampire films.  When I last checked (Fall 1988), it was not available on video, although the 1927 silent version is available on video.      Overall evaluation: very good.  Recommended if you want to see a "quality" Dracula film. Reviewer:  Thomas E.
