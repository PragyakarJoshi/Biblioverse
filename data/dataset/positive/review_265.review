     Well, I'd give BEETLEJUICE a rather high rating, but I have to point out something first.  I've seen the director, Tim Burton's, other work, namely the Disney shorts "Vincent" and "Frankenweenie" (I exclude PEE WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE only because I think that film conformed to Paul Reuben's concept more than Burton's), and I have loved his sense of style and humor.  It's silliness, but silliness that draws upon an almost cartoon- like attitude and a bright lampooning of certain cinematic fashions.  "Vincent" had send-ups of the Corman/Price Edgar Allen Poe works, and "Frankenweenie" contained howlers from the James Whales FRANKENSTEIN films -- an impressive achievement, considering how well Mel Brooks mined this subject in YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.      BEETLEJUICE is no exception; it's got more imagination and cleverness (in both visually and in the script) than anything else I've seen this year.  I wouldn't highlight anything for you here, because it's too much fun to discover what Burton has done with ghost story conventions.  For the most part, he tends to provide a pretty logical hierarchy for the land of the undead, though he leaves a few things (like the Sandworms and the fates of several characters) up in the air (ha-ha).  Most of all, though, the film is a whirling dervish of visual gags; while the special effects are primitive at points, the imagination with which they are used makes up for any lack of technical shine.  If you like Warner Bros. cartoons, I really think you'll like this; it contains a lot of features which are personally appealing but not universally appealing.  Let us just say that if you liked his earlier short films, you'll like this one.      The last scene (Belafonte was never so good!) will last me for a long, long time -- what a bizarre, beautifully goofy fantasy!  A big thumbs-up for me -- worth $6, or twice at $3.50. ----- Footnote:  Saw BEETLEJUICE for the second time last night, and whatever reservations I had about the film in my previous film, scratch them.  The sound was much better during this showing, and being able to comprehend more of the lines (especially Keaton's), I think the show was firing on all eight cylinders.  A $5.00 film, easily, and my favorite movie so far this year.
