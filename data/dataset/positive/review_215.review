     It is tough to say exactly where this film went wrong.  This is a sad parable of a boy with rat-like features.  For years he has lived in a junkyard, thought by everyone to be just one more legend.  Then he is kidnapped and falls into the hands of Sondra Locke, who wants to exploit him to make a fortune.  In retrospect, a lot of the film was probably intended to be funny but just wasn't.  The film's view of humanity as being entirely selfish and callous just is too familiar.  Like HAROLD AND MAUDE, this film was probably not intended to be a first-run hit but to become a cult film.  Unfortunately, it never has the right touch.  RATBOY is a production of Clint Eastwood's company Malpaso. These days usually Eastwood directs Malpaso films; this time he has allowed his frequent co-star to direct.  Rating: 0.  (All films will be rated on the -4 to +4 scale.)      This film came as something of a surprise, not because it was unusual but because after a few good reviews it turned out to be remarkably and unexpectedly usual.  In spite of pretensions to be something more, PERSONAL SERVICES is little different from a lot of English sex comedies that get picked up to run on cable after midnight.  Julie Waters (who was so good in EDUCATING RITA) plays a character the film claims was inspired by but not based on Cynthia Payne, a notorious London madam.  Due to unfortunate financial pressures, Cynthia is forced to become first a prostitute and then a madam. For a hard-hitting, realistic view of the world of prostitution, PERSONAL SERVICES is right up there with THE BEST LITTLE WHOREHOUSE IN TEXAS.  There is no attempt at impartiality, and eventually the film degenerates to pure sex farce.  Rating: 0.      Spend a couple of hours safety-pinned to a punk rocker.  See Sid Vicious slam his head against a brick wall to get a reaction from his girl friend. Watch him for two hours doing the same thing figuratively to get a recation from anyone who will give it.  This is an uncompromising film that never asks you to care for punk rocker Sid or his girlfriend Nancy, just as they never seem to first we see Sid among the London punk culture.  They do likeable things like spray paint graffiti on borrowed apartments or kick in windshields of Rolls Royces.  In the second part of the film we see them among bewildered non-punkers.  They go to the United States as part of a tour and, among other activities, visit Nancy's grandparents who quickly tire of the little parasites.  The title characters lead pointless, useless lives that are cut mercifully short by early deaths.  Rating: +1.
