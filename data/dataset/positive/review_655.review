Overview: Take one *very* rich man.  Add one "smart cookie" who has not had good breaks and is "working the streets."  Mix well.  Add one very sappy ending.  Serve.  For a formula movie, it was entertaining.  Not recommended for children.      The acting was above par (Gere downplayed, Roberts overplayed) and  although the plot left a lot to be desired (anyone could have figured it out from the first few frames) it proved to be a fun movie.      Some of the characterizations and motivations that surrounded Gere and Roberts were poorly drawn sketches that lacked any real substance.  Others were well defined and were played by actors clearly able to understate the roles. The overall lack of emotion throughout the film may make it seen disjointed at times, but also provides an excellent counterbalence to those times when the emotion is show.  Those emotions, sometimes a delicate as the changes in Roberts face as she watches her first opera, have far more impact than they would have had this picture been made with a constant flow of emotional highs and lows.      Although the plotting is somewhat predictable, almost everyone can leave it with a smile (maybe shaking their head no, since it is so predictable, but smiling).  A feel-good movie that doesn't require a large amount of thought, but does provide entertainment.
