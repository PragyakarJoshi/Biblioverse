     Let me blurt it right out:  BROADCAST NEWS is one of the best films of the year.  It's common for the studios to hold their Oscar hopefuls for Christmas. We should be hearing about this film again in February.      The cast is fabulous.  Albert Brooks gets most of the film's many funny lines and delivers a poignant performance as the well-educated reporter who just can't make it on camera.  William Hurt shows yet another facet of his talent by playing the well-meaning but shallow sportscaster who is hurtled toward the anchor desk by sheer dint of good looks.  He's not really an airhead, but he is, as we say in the trade, just a little behind the audience. My favorite discovery was Holly Hunter (if she isn't nominated then the Academy has less soul than even I suspect).  As the obsessive-compulsive news producer she dominates the film while she tries to dominate her job.  There is also what amounts to a wonderful cameo by a well-known actor, but I don't want to spoil it for you.  You'll know what I mean when you see the film.      The intelligent script is fairly littered with gems.  I heard so many good lines, many of them in background conversation, that I can't begin to remember them all.  It makes me want to rent it on video and sit down with a note pad and a remote control.  As the story is told of the developing love triangle all three characters are brought out as sympathetic, breathing human beings.  We wind up liking them each so much that we don't want any of them to be hurt. But the bittersweet nature of the comedy starts to appear near the end when we realize that in a triangle *somebody* has to lose.  The ending surprised me and may disappoint some, but rings very true.      BROADCAST NEWS is refreshingly well-researched.  Everything about the frenetic, neurotic nature of television is right on the money.  Most people will probably think that it was all exaggerated for the movie.  I hope at least that they learn something about what goes on behind the little glass screen. But don't go just to get educated.  Go to enjoy yourself.
