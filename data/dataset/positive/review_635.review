     To some people, the term "B-movie" translates as: low quality film-making.  If "quality" translates as high budgets, big-name actors, and grand themes, then that equation would seem to be true; but as any progressive quality-assurance person will tell you, that's a somewhat arbitrary definition of "quality."  A more useful definition is: "Conformance to specifications." Or, more simply:  "Does it accomplish what it is trying to do?"      Using such a definition, it would seem likely that there are more "high-quality" B-movies than A-movies, since B-movies rarely (and almost never successfully) have any higher ambition than to entertain -- which should be a relatively simple goal.      TREMORS begins in the back-of-beyond in Nevada -- a gritty little country-store town with the name of "Perfection" -- with two handymen, Earl and Val, who do the dirty and dusty work for the region's few inhabitants.  They're a couple of tough fellas, but they've had enough; they pack up their belongings in their beat-up 4x4 and are heading out of town when STRANGE AND DEADLY OCCURRENCES block their way and lead them and the inhabitants of Perfection in a struggle for survival against ...  THINGS ...        I don't really need to say any more about the story than that; you undoubtedly get the general idea.  Which leads to the next question:  Well, is this movie any good?  The answer to this question relates directly to the discussion of "quality" above.      I cannot describe TREMORS in terms of any superlatives -- there is nothing original about this film, there is nothing in it that stands out as exceptional, and there is nothing particularly memorable about it.  But I don't dare say anything unkind about it either, for if one accepts the premise that this is a B-movie and isn't intended to do anything but give the viewer a good ride for an hour-and-a-half, it absolutely succeeds on those terms.  In fact, it is so competent and deft that it could be used as a textbook case of "HOW TO MAKE A GOOD B-MOVIE."  (One wonders if the credit "CAROL ANNE HURD -- EXECUTIVE PRODUCER" has something to do with it.)      We have a plot that clicks along nicely with few false moves; the story is developed intelligently and resolved equally intelligently.  The dialogue makes few false steps and the acting is competent throughout.      The characters drive the film; TREMORS avoids the twin traps of either making them comic-book heroes or condescending to them as rustic clods; they're ordinary people who are reacting sensibly to a survival situation.  Val and Earl may be uneducated and unwashed shit-kickers, but they're decent people and not stupid or cowardly; and even the local survivalist couple, while the butt of a few jabs, are doing the right things when the situation gets rough.      And TREMOR's biggest asset is that it hits EXACTLY the right tone:  It takes itself JUST SERIOUSLY ENOUGH to keep the viewer going, without collapsing into outright comedy.      Okay, this isn't a great film, and I know those who want something a little more innovative and artistic will probably hate it.  But those who are less particular will find their time and money well spent, and may even want to give a little restrained applause while they sit there with a smile on their faces in appreciation of this good-natured horror flic.      Oh, yes, the caveats: moderate foul language -- a little gore; whether gratuitous or not is arguable.
