Movie Review 1 - "A Fish Called Wanda" (R) - (Comedy) **************   ------------------------------------      This movie has to be the funniest comedy I have seen in 4 or 5 years.  The movie stars John Cleese, of Monty Python fame, Jaime Lee Curtis, and Kevin Kline.  A FISH CALLED WANDA has sick jokes, dirty jokes, dead animal jokes, and a very good plot.  The plot concerns a gang of thieves who decide to rob a bank of 10 million dollars worth of diamonds and jewels.  All of the hoodlums get away from the police from the robbery except one of them.  Deciding he will probably go to jail never to see his reward, the caught hoodlum hides the loot in a train station pay locker and hides the key to the locker in the treasure chest located in the bottom of a goldfish aquarium!!!  Never mind that all of the above occurs in the first ten minutes of the film!!!  John Cleese is hilarious as the stiff-necked attorney who ends up getting involved in this mess.  Jaime Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline, as two of the thieves, portray a strange "sister-brother" relationship.  This wicked comedy is funny, funny, funny.  The movie will soon be available on video.  It has played for a long run in many movie theatres.  I rate it ***1/2 out of a possible four. Mini Reviews  - "The Naked Gun" (PG) - Comedy                  ----------------------------       The movie stars Leslie Nielsen in an "Airplane"-type comedy filled with slapstick, sight sags, and generally silly humor.  Priscilla Presley plays the femme fatale to Nielsen's attempted straight-face approach to his role as a bumbling police detective about to solve his biggest case.  The movie has cameos from actors and sports heros including O.J. Simpson, Reggie Jackson, and a look-alike to Queen Elizabeth.  This movie, though, is not *half* as funny as A FISH CALLED WANDA.  THE NAKED GUN is still worth a see.  I rate THE NAKED GUN ** out of four.
