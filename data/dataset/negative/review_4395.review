DR. NO (1962) **1/2 (out of four)         OH NO would be a more suitable title for this one. It's the  first James Bond movie, but it hardly ranks as one of the best. Sean  Connery is entertaining as usual as 007, but the movie itself lags. The  action and death trap scenes are barely thrilling. Besides that, the plot  is never actually explained. We know Dr. No has his underwater  hideout beneath an island, but what's it there for? What nuclear device  is he about to launch at the end of the movie, and at what target? It  wouldn't hurt to let the audience in on these things.         Bond is off to Jamaica in DR. NO (and, if you've never heard  someone with an English accent say, "Hey mon!" you're a mighty  deprived person) to find out what happened to a missing fellow agent.  Along the way, he wakes up to find a tarantula in his bed (It's sad  when you're so drunk you don't know who you're going home with.)  and trespasses on No's island, where he finds a beautiful woman  (Ursula Andress) gathering seashells. He also finds a few Jamaicans  opening machine gun fire on him. You have to take the good with the  bad... Sorry, I've been working on the side as a fortune cookie writer  lately. My favorite message to people who have just finished eating  Chinese food: "Your sweet and sour pork was infected with E. Coli  bacteria."         DR. NO is worth watching just because it was the movie that  started off the seemingly endless set of sequels. It's one of the weakest  Connery vehicles (with YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE taking the cake),  though, and has much more dialogue than action. You know a James  Bond movie moves slowly when Bond only nails two women in the  entire movie. Promiscuity is the all-encompassing gauge of success...  Another one of my cookie fortunes. I apologize.
