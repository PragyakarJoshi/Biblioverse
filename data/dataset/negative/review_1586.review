 Spiceworld (1998) 1 star out of 4. Starring the Spice Girls.  Spice World  tries very hard to be A Hard Day's Night. Unfortunately, it turns out to be "Blandworld," a movie aimed at the female pre-pubescent fans of the Spice Girls, a British girls group whose members offer more attitude than talent.  Luckily, it is their attitude that salvages this movie. While the Spice Girls are by no means actresses, their lack of self-consciousness before the camera gives the film a naturalistic vibrancy.  As performers the Spice Girls are merely adequate. They strut and pose rather than dance, and they at least sing on key. Their songs are unremarkable, and after a while, they all begin to sound alike.  Despite cameos from Elton John and Elvis Costello, among others, most of the regular performances are embarassingly hammy.  It's a shame to see a wonderful actor such as Richard E. Grant, as the girls' manager, mug his way through the proceedings. Roger Moore, as the behind-the-scenes Mr. Big, is a travesty.  More than anything else, Spice World  needs a harder edge. The girls try too hard to please and to be liked and accepted, unlike the Beatles who, in A Hard Day's Night, enjoyed thumbing their noses at the establishment.  A little more seasoning added to the Spice World  recipe, could have made for a tasty treat instead of a safe, unoriginal extended music video.
