     Skip it.  The computer-generated FX are cute, but the story is all over the place. The simple, sweet premise of a very lonely ghost has been expanded to include a variety of vulgar subplots, ranging from hidden treasure to a kitchen-sink explanation of the afterlife. Groan.  The result is too broad to be believable.      If the jokes were stronger (say, a la THE FLINTSTONES), we might have something here.  But with the exception of a few good lines, there isn't enough to sustain adult interest. Even a half-dozen well-placed cameos don't generate the guffaws that they should.  Kids won't mind, though.  They'll love the eye-popping production design that looks quite ookey on the inside (and quite phony on the outside).      We all could do without the wish-fulfillment ending.  The final reel is the worst, with enough ghosts, angels, and misplaced spirits to send even the lowest-level paranormal screaming from the theater.  And, yes, that *is* Little Richard singing "Casper the Friendly Ghost" over the closing credits. Good golly! BOTTOM LINE:  Strictly for kids, even if the language isn't the best in places.
