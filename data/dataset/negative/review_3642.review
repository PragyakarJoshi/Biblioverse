     Oh, how the mighty have fallen.  Amy Heckerling, director of the now-classic FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, after free-falling through LOOK WHO'S TALKING and its (first) sequel, has turned in an unquestionably dismal look at the wealthy teen's life in the mid-90's.      But this ain't no 90210.  Starring Alicia Silverstone and a gaggle of talentless teen actors and actresses, the title of CLUELESS is perfect Truth in Advertising.  Told as a "This is my life" from rich kid Cher (Silverstone), the film follows the socialite through her daily ritual--schmoozing for better grades, applying makeup, leading on boys, and generally being a snob (but proud of it).  Flat jokes abound; the laughs are *at* the cast, not with them.      I don't know that I was expecting a lot from Silverstone.  With her track record, CLUELESS is actually one of the better entries.  Of course, this role isn't much of a stretch for Aerosmith's moll.  With dialogue like "You know ... stuff!" Silverstone really seems to find herself at home.  Maybe I just didn't get it because I'm not a 17-year-old girl living in Beverly Hills.      There's simply not much else to be said about CLUELESS.  My prevailing thought during the film was "How long have I actually been watching this hideous movie?"  The answer?  Forever and ever.  Even traditionally classic comedians like Wallace Shawn and Julie Brown (plus about 50 pounds) are given dull parts and little screen time.  A more unnecessary film hasn't been made this year.      Maybe I would have liked it better if it had been in focus.  Well, probably not.
