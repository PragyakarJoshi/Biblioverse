     If you get turned on by action, explosions, train derailments, planes crashing and practically no dialogue, BROKEN ARROW is the film for you.  For my part I cannot help but wonder why the newly rejuvenated Travolta would be in a film so senseless that its whole plot can be summed up in one sentence:      A pilot on a B-3 Stealth bomber carrying two nuclear warheads decides to blackmail the U. S. Government for millions of dollars or he will blow up the bomb and put millions of people's lives in danger. That's it.  That's the whole story.  Not what one would call subtle. (Broken Arrow refers to the lost nuclear missile.)      John Woo, who directed Van Damme in HARD TARGET, and has made many action films, is just the man for this kind of film but you have to like that kind of mayhem or you will find yourself laughing in the theater's darkness at the utter absurdity of the stunts and action happening up on the screen.      John Travolta is the villain, Christian Slater is the hero, Samantha Mathis is a park ranger who gets involved.  A lot of talent wasted.
