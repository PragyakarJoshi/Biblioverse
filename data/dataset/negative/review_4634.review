     Woof!  DIABOLIQUE reminds me of those activity-book pages that I used to love-- the ones titled "what's wrong with this picture?" So many problems surface in this failed French-film remake that it's difficult to know where to start!  The tone is the worst-- an overly oppressive mood that lands with an almost-audible thud.  The characters then play too close to camp, which is probably the best way to take this tabloid- worthy tale of a wife (Isabelle Adjani) and a mistress (Sharon Stone) who conspire to kill their husband/ lover (Chazz Palminteri).  Try this for dialogue:  "If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not hang for fried chicken." No, not as good-bad as SHOWGIRLS, but close.  Very close.  The defining moment comes at the end, when Stone and Adjani are finishing some business in the shallow end of a swimming pool.  Cut to an underwater shot of their struggle and both actresses are still wearing heels.  Ouch.
