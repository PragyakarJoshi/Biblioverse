Everything in The Phantom you have seen many times before    and there is nothing new presented here. Wincer displays     absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action         sequence. Billy Zane is wooden as the hero. Kristy Swanson   is given very little to do, and does very little with it.    Treat Williams, looking like Rhett Butler but sounding like  Mickey Mouse, is one of the worst villains I have ever seen  in a movie. Only Catherine Zeta Jones, as one of Williams    cohorts turns in a good performance. She has energy and      spunk, which the movie needed much more of. Oh yeah, the     Phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly     played out you won't even care. About the only things I can  recommend are a good performance by Jones, and some colorful scenery. However, if youre looking for a fun family movie,   go watch the underrated Flipper. This is not a good movie.
