Directed by Kevin Reynolds Starring Kevin Costner, Dennis Hopper, Tina Majorino, Jeanne Tripplehorn.      I enjoyed it. It's more than possible you will too!  If you like action movies in the STAR WARS vein, don't take any notice of the journalistic hogwash 'cos if you only see it on video you'll be kicking yourself that you didn't get out and view all those unbelievable special FX on the widest screen you could find.      It doesn't take a movie buff to see what so inspired the company about Reynold's vision that they weren't prepared to quit.  "The Mutant" doesn't sound like a promising role, but Costner turns it into one of his best characters. Hopper moves with alacrity to top his performance as the "baddie" in SPEED.  The kid is great.      Any message intended? Well it does rather capture how people in the third world must feel, often on the knife edge of existence.  Kinda makes you think.
