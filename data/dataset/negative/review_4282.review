        About the easiest way to make a comedy is to use a monkey (in this case, an orangutan which is actually an ape)) as the film's hero.  A monkey, by definition, is a comedic character.  Let him run loose and you have a funny film.  Adults will laugh but the kids will laugh even harder.  Money in the bank.         Lord Rutledge (Rupert Everett) is a nogoodnik, a jewel thief who owns and uses Dunston, the monkey, to do the dirty work of stealing.  Dunston escapes his conniving master and checks into the classy Majestic Hotel owned by Mrs. Dubrow (Faye Dunaway) and run by the very efficient manager, Robert Grant (the Jason Alexander of the Seinfeld show).  The comedy surrounding the antics and havoc as Dunston goes ape (excuse the pun) is further enhanced by a youngster Eric Lloyd,  and Paul Rubens as an animal control officer.
