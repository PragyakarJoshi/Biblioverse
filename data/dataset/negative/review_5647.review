There I was, trying to get out of an elevator.  And what happens?  This woman tries to block my way by trying to get in, before I can get out.  So, I said "excuse me", hopin' this pushy woman will at least let me get out of the elevator.  Well, she side stepped and bumped me by the door just so that she can get in.  Of course, the elevator ain't gonna go anywhere until I get out.  Does this behavior make sense to anybody?  And why is this not an isolated incidence? Speaking of things not making any sense, MAXIMUM RISK came out and I had to go check it out.  It's another one of Jean Claude's movies where he kicks few butts but he's trying to put more acting in it.  I hate to say it but he's not going to win any Oscar any time soon.  And yes, there was actually something that resembles a plot but you had to look hard for it after Jean Claude's twin gets killed in first 5 min of the movie. One nakkid boob (yeah Natasha!).  4 Doz bullets.  2 doz dead bodies.  48 on the vomit meter.  One moon shot (sorry, not Jean Claude).  What we got here are:  Running-fu, jumping for life-fu, attack of killer car chase-fu, mysterious dead body that flipped over-fu, funeral-fu, trip to the lawyer's office from hell-fu, homeboy in the hood-fu, free drink-fu, key from heaven-fu, attack of garbage can lid-fu, and of course attack of killer cabbie-fu.  Video hall of fame nominations to Natasha Henstridge for saying stuff like "you got harder since the last time" and to Jean Claude Van Damm for saying stuff like "why didn't you tell me".  Two stars.  Shaggy Bob says wicked! Spoilers - Jean Claude's character's twin is getting chased by two guys and well, he dies.  Enter Jean Claude.  Now, he didn't know that he had a twin brother.  So, he wants to find out what kind of person his dead brother was.  Of course the FBI and the Russian mob are mixed in the whole mess.  Oh yeah, you can't forget about Natasha who acts like a guide through the movie so the audience won't get lost.  No one is going to win any awards for acting but some of the fight scenes were pretty cool. If you're waiting for a call from Elizabeth Anne Holden, then stay by the phone.  If she actually gives you call and wants to go out with you, don't take her to this one.  If she asks for an action movie to get some release but not too much brain dead beatings, then consider this one.  But only then. Alien Alert!  I don't get it.  A part of a freeway was torn down and effectively increased the traffic.  Of course, this particular stretch of the freeway was the only link between northern and southern part of the city during major event like a marathon.  Now, more freeway got torn down and because there hasn't been any major gridlock, it's considered a success and therefore, the freeway does not need to be replaced?  Hello?  Is anybody with any synaptic activities in the city hall?  I used to be able to get out of town in 8 min.  After the first demolition, I was able to get out of town in 15min.  Now, it takes me 20 min just to get to the freeway.  And that's success?  Hello? For wisdom according to Shaggy Bob, hit that reply key now.
