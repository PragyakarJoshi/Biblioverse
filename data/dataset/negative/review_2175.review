Uglier than Freddy Krueger, more sadistic  than Jason Voorhees, weirder that Norman Bates not to mention far more  humourous than the Crypt Keeper, Pigsby is on a seperate pedestal entirely  so far as villains are concerned. In this outrageous sequel to The sLaughter House, the former 'Laughter House  Clown Training Institute' opens again for 'business'. For those who came in  late, Pigsby was the ClownMaster before a Satan-inspired nuclear accident  rendered him and his trainees into horrible mutants who try to entertain to  death any foolish humans who came near the sLaughterhouse. As in the first  movie, Pigsby and his mindless minions again dollop out their special brand  of shock entertainment to the unwitting victims; a bunch of airhead  teenagers in search of a makeout nest. You want decapitations? You got'em! Blood splattering everywhere? Like mist!  Impalements? Plenty for all! Convulsing organs wrenched prematurely from a  'volunteer, spasmodically squirting pustuous bile, in the magic show to end  all magic shows? You won't believe your eyes. You'll die laughing...all over again, with sLaughterhouse II." "sLaughterhouse 2 and its predecessor are films in the tradition of  Halloween, Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street. The story, while  clichÃ©d, provides for the shock horror entertainment that audiences are  looking for in this kind of film.  The special makeup effects by Ray Wolfe  and his team are astounding to say the least, and Pigsby's face is even more  expressive and realistic than before. Victor Caliph, again as Pigsby gives  him a  larger-than-life physical presence. And unlike the first film where  they brought Dariel Andazola in to dub Pigsby's voice, they have actually  used Mr. Caliph's, which is just as phlegmatic and even spookier." -New York Film Review I thought I would include these quotes because they are quite good and I  agree quite a lot with what they say. sLaughterhouse 2 is the sequel to the  1991 movie sLaughterhouse set in an evil clown school filled with creepy  monter-clowns. A bunch of teenagers (four to be precise) stumble into it, in  this film, a bad move! The hapless teens are quite pleasant to watch, except when they are being  impaled! Julia Mooreton plays Julie, a cheerleader out looking for some fun.  Freddy Samuels, of TV's 'Daydream' fame is quite good as Julie's love, Jim  the Quarterback of the high-school football team. Nancy McLintic plays Suzy,  the worrier of the group and Julie's best friend, with a special sixth  sense. She cautions them to not enter the sLaughterhouse when she says  "Look, you guys, I have a feeling about this place." Foolishly, the others  don't listen to her. The other main character is Billy, Jim's wisecracking  buddy, played by Haskell Cunningham. At the start he and Suzy hate each  other and are only exploring around because their best friends are there.  But by the end they have grown to love each other, and when Pigsby finally  dumps them into the acid, their skeletons float up in an embrace. Their last  words to each other are "I love you". The romance was quite touching and it  is sure to appeal to the female members of the audience. While Steven Snow's screenplay is quite corny, it has some quite funny  one-liners especially from Billy and of course, Pigsby. Before the night  watchman is killed, Pigsby asks: "Do you want to hear a killer joke?" He  then proceeds to scream so loudly in his ear that his brain explodes. I  frankly went in, expecting a Horror movie with comic bits thrown in. While  it is quite a good movie, it just wasn't what I was hoping for personally.  The other problem, is that the film switches from being deadly serious at  parts, to mocking itself at others, and then back again. I simply hope that  when the sequal is made (and I guarantee they'll make one) the writers  figure out what sort of film they're trying to make. Michael Welton is quite a good director, but sometimes he tries too hard and  it is not as successful, as it could be. There are some quite strange,  scary, funny touches in places, like the blood oozing from the letterbox and  the bowling game with skulls. Some things are gratituosley violent though.  This is not a film for young children, I'd recommend 15 and above. The  music, by Johann Simmet is perfect for the film. Highlighting every scene  and quite spine tingly and scary. In the words of Pigsby, 'Sit back and relax. You're going to have the time  of what's left of your life!' <HR>Get Your Private, Free Email at <A HREF="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</A>
