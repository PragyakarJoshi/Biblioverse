What do you say to people you sort'a know?  I mean what do you do when  you come across people you casually know but nothing beyond that?  Ok,  so you say "hi" since you don't want to come across like you treat them  like a plague but then what?  Uneasy silence?  Isn't that more awkward  than if you didn't say anything at all?  If you ingore them, at least  you don't have to deal with the person.  On the down side, they'll  think you're prude or something.  Do the opinions of those who you  really don't care matter?  Then again, you could aways tell 'em you had  a bad day... Speaking of having no real good solutions, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE came out  and I had to go check it out.  It's a spin off from the old TV series  of the same name.  Yup, it's packed with actions.  Minimum dialogs.   And will keep you on the edge of the seat.  Yeah, what else is new?   They got all kinds of cool toys but upgraded to today's technology.   And of couse the cold war is over so different kind of villain is  needed.  Of course the guys have to accomplish impossible missions to  save the day. No nakkid boobs.  No bullets.  7 dead bodies.  19 on the vomit meter.   No moon shots.  What we got here are:  playing dead-fu, smoking in the  airplane-fu, attack of killer briefing-fu, breath freshner from hell- fu, finger printing-fu, glasses-fu, attack of killer elevator-fu,  exploding car-fu, exploding bubble gum-fu, finding religion- fu,  hellucinations-fu, attack of trackable software-fu, sweat-fu an of  course knife-fu.  Video hall of fame nominations to Emmanuelle Beart  for saying stuff like "Jim is dead" and to Ving Rhames for saying  stuff like "There was no physical evidence" and to Jon Voight for  saying "When did you know".  And of course to Henry Czervy for saying  stuff like "He wanted us to know" and to Tom Cruise for saying "I'll  always remember you this way."  Three stars.  Shaggy Bob says wicked! Spoiler - The cold war is over but deep undercover agents are still  about.  A half of a list of all the agents has been stolen.   The team  has to not only recover the list but also pin the guy who took the  first half and the buyer.  If you recall any of the TV series, it's not  all that hard to do.  But what do you do when there's a traitor in your  midst?  Who can you trust?  Better yet, who can you not trust and why?   Of course, to prove your innocence, you have to break in to the most  secure place in the world. Alien Alert!  Ok, so Bob Dole quit his day job to see if he can get a  better one.  I guess with all the free time he now has, he came out  with a brilliant plan to cut down on welfare.  In it, he restricts aid  to 2 years and upto 5 years during one's life time.  Correct me if I'm  wrong but isn't the reason why you get welfare because you can't find  a job?  And peoeple want goverment to solve the problems.  Not unless  we elect people who knows what they're doing. For wisdom according to Shaggy Bob, hit that reply key now.
