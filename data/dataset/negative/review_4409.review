        This is one of the weaker James Bond movies out there, but  it's still not that bad, if you don't mind a movie with a running time of  over 130 minutes. It would have been better with about thirty minutes  of boredom cut out and if, perhaps, the director had coaxed a better  performance out of Christopher Walken. I like the guy and think he's a  decent actor and definitely one of the strangest individuals on the  planet (good to know I'm not alone), but as villain Zorin he's way too  bland.         Roger Moore makes his seventh and final appearance as  James Bond, and I think it was about time for the guy to step down. In  this one, he just doesn't seem too enthusiastic about being the single  most indestructible babe magnet on the planet. Of course, I wouldn't  be able to manfacture much enthusiasm either if I had to sleep with  Grace Jones. That's a nasty-looking woman right there.         The plot this time has Walken as an ambitious microchip  manufacturer who plans to create an earthquake that will destroy  Silicon Valley, eliminating his competition. Maybe that's where Bill  Gates got the idea to send the CEO's of Atari and Commodore 64 to  sleep with the fishes. Grace Jones, the least feminine woman out there  (Sandra Bernhard being the runner-up in that competition) is his  musclebound assistant, May Day. Her name, of course, comes from the  phrase shouted by every man who's ever seen her topless. And as  usual, it's up to James Bond to stop everything.         A VIEW TO A KILL moves slowly and is acted without  much eagerness or excitement, yet has some merit as a Bond movie.  It's got all the violence and chase scenes, some that are fun, some  absurd. The sequence with Bond hanging from a fire truck ladder falls  into the latter category (Latter. Ladder. Get it?), as does the entire last  twenty minutes of the movie, which I'll just say involves a dirigible  and the Golden Gate bridge. Still, nearly every James Bond movie is  better than this one, which should be watched only by true fans of the  series.
