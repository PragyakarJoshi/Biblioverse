     It's not every day that we get to see a reworking of CASABLANCA, much less one that (a.) is adapted from a comic book and (b.) stars Pamela Anderson Lee.  Ms. Lee, a.k.a. "the Baywatch babe," a.k.a. "you're looking rather buoyant this evening," plays the title character, a bounty-hunting bar owner who lives in a (near) future where civil war is being waged between the Nazi-looking Congressionals and the underground Resistance.  They all come to Barb's place, though, because she doesn't take sides.  That is, until a former lover-- and Resistance alley-- steps out of the past and into her bar.  Sound familiar?      There's more, of course, including a fat man who rides in a bucket loader, a pair of contact lenses that fool retina scans, and, oh yeah, a rocket-firing motorcycle.  (Trust me: it sounds more exciting than it is.) BARB WIRE has a great "look," but director David Hogan doesn't deliver a decent action sequence until the end.  And don't expect any Bogarts or Bergmans, either; most of the cast appears to have been hired for "assets" other than their acting abilities.  (Calm down guys, this stuff doesn't even qualify as *soft*-core porn.  Just cleavage cleavage cleavage and only the *occasional* peek behind curtains number one and two.) No, there isn't much to this movie beyond the, uh, obvious, but if you love CASABLANCA, and you can stomach Pamela Lee's hissed-through- clinched-teeth line readings, then this may be the matinee for you.
