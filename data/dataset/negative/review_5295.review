Review- Early on in Greg Arraki's The Doom Generation, one of the  characters spys on a couple having sex. He masturbates, and when he is  finished, he licks the fluid off of his hand. Perhaps the most disgusting  and repulsive scene in recent memory, the scene wouldnt be so bad if it  actually had a purpose. It didn't. It was only an attempt by Arraki to  gross the audience out. I guess he got what he wanted, but I sure didn't  get what I wanted. Duval and McGowan play Jordan and Amy, young lovers who go on a road trip.  They stop at a convenience store and are held up by the store clerk  (don't ask}. A drifter named Xavier tries to save them, and ends up  blowing off the head of the clerk. The head flies off of the screen, then  we see it land in what appears to be a shopping cart full of food. Then  Arraki gives us the pleasure of seeing the clerk's headless body with  gobs of blood spurting out of his neck. Then we get to see the head, yes  the head, still screaming. Well now, here we got two of the most  disgusting scenes I have ever scene in a movie since I Spit On Your Grave.  I have the feeling that if Arraki had directed The Hitcher, he would  have shown us the scene where the girls body is snapped in half. I don't  even want to imagine what would've happened had he directed Seven. After the killing they take Xavier along with them. Then Xavier  masturbates while watching Jordan and Amy have sex. Then Xavier seduces  Amy and they have sex. Then some guy waith a mask on comes looking for  Amy. Then they kill someone else in a scene just as disgusting as the  other two I mentioned.. Jordan and Amy have sex again. Then Jordan  masturbates while watching Xavier and Amy have sex. Then they all three  have sex together. Then I just kneeled down and prayed that this  nightmare of a film watching experience would end.  The actors in this movie are beyond incompetent. They don't show any  talent whatsoever. Their performances are the level of a bad junior high  school play. Even a cameo by the talented Parker Posey is ruined by  horiible dialogue and a scene that makes no sense whatsoever. The only  reason Arraki gave us that scene was to gross us out one more time.Greg  Arraki throws one gratuitous and disgusting scene after another upon the  audience, and I hope he never gets the chance to direct a movie ever  again.  Theatrical Release 1995. Reviewed on video in 1996.
