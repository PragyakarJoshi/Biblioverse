     Walter has a problem.  He needs a date for a dinner party being thrown for one of his firms biggest clients.  His regular girlfriend has stood him up at the last minute, and now he's desperate.      Walter finally accepts a blind date with Nadia, a friend of his sister-in-law, and, ignoring the warnings of his sister-in-law, allows her to drink.  After all, Nadia is a charming and beautiful woman.  What harm could come from sharing one bottle of champagne?      Unfortunately, no one told Walter that Nadia is a hopeless dipsomaniac who, after just one drink, gains the destructive force of a tornado.  Walter, of course, has a miserable night.  Over the next 6 hours, he is the butt of every slapstick gag known.  In addition to being mugged, jailed, and fired he ends up in love, and responsible for saving Nadia from the plotting of her unscrupulous ex-fiance.      BLIND DATE has everything you would expect from a Blake Edwards movie, except Julie Andrews.  The dialogue is funny, the slapstick is funny, and the pacing is good.  For high-concept comedy, it's pretty good, but there are several problems.  At first Bruce Willis struggles against his David Adison image, playing Walter as a disorganized portfolio analyst with no style or social skills, but then falls into his "Moonlighting" persona.  Kim Bassinger gives a good performance as Nadia, but the role requires that she only behave drunkenly and then helpless, so there isn't much room for depth.  It also has the one hundredth movie dog named Rambo this year, and several running jokes that quickly become stale and predictable.
