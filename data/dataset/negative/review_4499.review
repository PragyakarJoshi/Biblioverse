Very wrong.  Comedienne Ellen DeGeneres makes her feature-film debut in  this astonishingly unfunny romantic comedy about a girl who can't get rid  of a guy.  The male in question is Bill Pullman-- or is it Jeff  Daniels?-- a well-to-do smoothy who initially sweeps DeGeneres off her  feet, until his increasingly bizarre behavior labels him as a  card-carrying member of the Psycho Squad.  Director Nick Castle (DENNIS  THE MENACE) and writers Chris Matheson, Kerry Ehrin, and Craig Munson  botch it big-time.  The script isn't tight enough; the tone isn't right  enough; and the comedy isn't black enough.  (Most disappointing to me: no  references to that other stalker movie, CAPE FEAR.)  Ms. DeGeneres makes  a bright impres-sion, sure, but the rest of the cast barely registers.   Joan Cusack is a loss as Pullman's crazed ex-girlfriend; Dean Stockwell  makes no impression as the P.I. that Ellen investigates.  And so on.   Skip it.  -- Mike Legeros - Raleigh, NC  <A HREF="mailto:legeros@nando.net">legeros@nando.net</A> (h) - <A HREF="mailto:legeros@unx.sas.com">legeros@unx.sas.com</A> (w) MOVIE HELL is on the Web!  <URL <A HREF="http://www.n-vision.com/hell/>">http://www.n-vision.com/hell/></A>
