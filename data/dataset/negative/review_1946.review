<A HREF="http://www.speakers-podium.com/susangranger.">http://www.speakers-podium.com/susangranger.</A>  Susan Granger's review of "BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS" (Buena Vista Pictures)    Writer/director Alan Rudolph has attempted to make a deep, dark comedy out of Kurt Vonnegut's satiric '70s fable - and has failed to such an extent that it's an embarrassment for all concerned. Bruce Willis plays a suicidal car dealer, Dwayne Hoover, a minor celebrity in Midland City since his commercials seem to play non-stop on local television. His pill-popping wife (Barbara Hersey) is clinically depressed, and his gay son (Lukas Haas) is an aspiring lounge singer. Is that why Dwayne thinks he's losing his mind? We're not really sure. Meanwhile, his devoted secretary (Glenne Headley) doubles as his hot-to-trot mistress and his sales manager (Nick Nolte) is a troubled transvestite. (Nick's legs do look sensational in sheer black stockings!)  Plus there's a pollution scandal. In the midst of this muddled mess, the town decides to honor a mumbling, misunderstood pulpy science-fiction writer named Kilgore Trout (Albert Finney) at its first arts festival. "Midland City is ready for a renaissance, and you shall be our Leonardo," gushes his sponsor. Predictably, when Dwayne Hoover meets Kilgore Trout (Kurt Vonnegut's alter ego), he discovers the meaning of life and achieves some kind of bewildering redemption. Appropriately, the '50s ballad "Stranger in Paradise" is an integral part of the soundtrack, repeatedly underscoring the bizarre caricatures and surreal situation. Like Terry Gilliam's adaptation of Hunter Thompson's "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," Alan Rudolph's attempt to dramatize Vonnegut's zany '60s protest fantasy seems distorted and woefully out of date. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Breakfast of Champions" is a crude, crass, incoherent 2. Flaky, tasteless breakfasts like this could lead to indigestion!
