        I've never written a review for a movie I haven't watched all  the way through, but I had to make an exception with POWDER. I  was about forty-five minutes into this one at a friend's house when  he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have  ended in violence had we not left the house. So I never got to finish  the movie and I'm sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to  watch half of a bad movie. But I can at least get a partial review out  of it, because I saw enough to know this one wasn't worth finishing  in the first place.         The movie centers around a freaky teenager who's spent  his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents' house. When  Grandpa dies (taking his department store down with him), social  worker Mary Steenburgen has to take Powder (first and middle  names? Gold Bond) to a state home, where we find out he's a  different from the other kids. Actually, we find out he's different  when we first see him, because he's the most pale individual  we've ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever.  When Powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie, the  father takes one look at him and says "He's not my son."  Obviously. All I want to know is where the Pillsbury Dough  Boy was nine months ago.         So the white-faced freak leaves his Neverland Ranch for  the state home and faces the ridicule of other kids. That is, until  they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him  "wear" his spoon ("You can either wear it on your nose or up your  ass." Decisions, decisions...) and he uses telepathic powers to draw  all the silverware in the room into a giant pile in the middle of the  table. So if his father is the Pillsbury Dough Boy, his mother must  be Sissy Spacek's Carrie character.         And you have to factor in two more things from the  subsequent scenes, as we find out Powder has some sort of  super-intelligence ("Your I.Q. test went straight off the chart!")  and attracts electrical power. This first shows up as Powder visits  the world of high school (If he's such a genius already, why would  he need a high school education?) and sits through a demonstration  in Jeff Goldblum's science class. Goldblum plugs in a "Jacob's  ladder" device that shows current running up two wires and  immediately the current flows across the room and into Powder's  chest. But Goldblum just stands there for about thirty seconds  watching, instead of just unplugging the damn thing. I guess he  was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third  bad movie in a row (following HIDEAWAY and NINE MONTHS).         That's about all I saw before the big fight began and, let  me tell you, that was twice as interesting as the movie itself. But  like I said, I saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible  melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities  and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into  mainstream civilization. None of these movies ever handle the  subject properly, instead introducing the feeble BEAUTY AND  THE BEAST copout of having a beautiful woman fall in love with  the guy's personality, overlooking his personal appearance. I already  had the female character picked out (the girl who was sitting next to  him in the back of the room during the electrocution scene), but I  guess I'll never know for sure what happened.
