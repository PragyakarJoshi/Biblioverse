Published In The Outreach Connection Newspaper (Jan. 18, 1996) Starring: Tim Roth, Antonio Banderas, Jennifer Beals, Ione Skye, David Proval,           Madonna, Valeria Golino, Paul Calderon, Bruce Willis and            Quentin Tarantino.   The origin of this atrocity began four years ago. Directors Allison Anders (Gas, Food, Lodging) Alexandre Rockwell (In The Soup) and renaissance man  Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) smoked the 1992 film  festival circuit. Fresh and hip, the trio bonded like two socks and a  sweater on tumble dry.   Shazam! Inspiration zapped Alexandre Rockwell. Why couldn't they merge  their talents and shoot a picture? (Mistake Numero Uno) They rang up  philosopher king Richard Linklater (Slacker, Dazed And Confused, Before  Sunrise). "Thanks but no thanks," was his reply. Smart move, O' Wise One.   Quentin conned bud Robert Rodriguez (El Mariachi, Desperado) and Rockwell  drew up the guidelines: four stories Crazy Glued by a rookie bellhop, a  run-down Hollywood hotel and New Year's Eve. Everyone wrote their script  in isolation, submitting it upon completion. (Mistake Numero Two-o)  The opening segment (The Missing Ingredient) showcases a coven of witches  renting the Honeymoon Suite. Broom carrying-Broomhilda-Wicked Witch Of The  West crones they ain't. We're talking Valeria Golino, Alicia Witt, Lili Taylor , Ione Skye, Sammi Davis and Madonna. Prior to filming, Madonna had an   apparent advantage over the other actresses. She didn't have to research  the part.   At their beck and call is Ted (Don't Call Me Theodore!) the bellboy. It's  Ted's first night on the job and he's as tightly strung as Alex Lifeson's  guitar. Unbeknownst to Ted (Tim Roth-Mistake Numero Four-o), he stocks the "missing ingredient" for the coven's resurrection spell. All in all, it's a sticky situation. (Mistake Numero Five-o)  Ted cannonballs out of the frying pan and into the fire delivering a bucket of ice. (Boy. These guests are lazy sloths.) By mistake, he walks in on a married couple. The wife (Jennifer Beals) is tied to a chair and gagged. Oops. Wrong room. Red-faced, Ted apologizes and retreats. The business end of a .357 Magnum stops him cold. The Wrong Man in the wrong place at the right time, Ted humors the sickos until he can split the scene. (Mistake Numero Six-o)  Two child actors (Lana McKissick and Danny Verduzco) outshine Antonio  Banderas in The Misbehavers. Gangster dad (Banderas) pays Ted to babysit his Damien-Omen children so he and his wife (Tamlyn Tomita) can paint the town  red. The parents book. Ted's left in charge. Scratch one Towering Inferno  hotel room.   Witches. Sexual deviants. Snot-nosed brats. Minimum wage or no minimum wage. Tips or no tips. Ted calls in his resignation. The hotel manager (Marisa  Tomei) begs Ted to complete one last task.   Staying in the penthouse is comedy star Chester Rush (Quentin Tarantino)  and friends. As instructed, Ted fetches them a chopping block, a bucket  of ice, a roll of twine, three nails and a hatchet. The occupants intend  on recreating an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents.   In The Man From Rio, Peter Lorre bets Steve McQueen his new car if McQueen can ignite a cigarette lighter three times in succession. If McQueen fails, his finger is lopped off. In their drunken stupor, Rush and pal Norman (Paul  Calderon) make an identical wager: Rush's sports car for Norman's digit. Ted  is paid handsomely to, if need be, drop the hatchet.  Four Rooms is a heartbreaker. Braced by Tarantino's leverage, the four directors had the chance to really do something special. They blew it. To feast on the Tarantino/Rodriguez double-bill (The Man From Hollywood, The Misbehavers), we have to sit through a pair of real snoozers. The Missing Ingredient and The Wrong Man are contributions Allison Anders and Alexandre Rockwell would have been better off locking in a musty chest and stashing it in the attic.   As a Tarantino junkie myself, I know what you are presuming. Two outta four  ain't bad, right? Hold yer horses, pardners. Tim Roth's inept execution tips the scales.   I'm not even sure what the hell he was attempting. Roth walks as if he had a phone booth shoved up his ass and behaves as if a car battery was attached to his testicles. Every line and movement is exaggerated. A magic mushroom  induced imitation of Jerry Lewis? A bungled try at physical comedy? Whatever that was, it's bleeding annoying and excruciating to behold fine actor  self-destruct.   (Audible sigh) Quentin. Quentin. Quentin. You wanna support your friends. I  respect that. A good friend will and should go to the wall for a chum. Chums though can't properly judge their friend's work. They'll politely stifle their genuine feelings so yours won't be bruised.   Plainly put, no director was hurt during the filming of this motion picture.   Four Rooms is rated E for Erratic. Beals rifling off synonyms for "penis" -  Madonna wearing a designer Glad Bag - Tim Roth + one pickled corpse + a  sister drop-kicking her brother Bret Hart style + guest star Marisa Tomei  sucking on a bong - Allison Anders + Tim Roth smacking a cig out of a  punk's mouth (twice) + waaay underage drinking - Alexandre Rockwell -  semi-nude witches doin' the Twist = Big-o Mistake-o.
