RULES OFÂ ENGAGEMENTÂ [Friedkin] -- Boy, did they screw up reel one! Really a mess from minute one to forty-five, an introduction asÂ thought provoking as colored toilet paper, the movie takes aÂ sudden turn forÂ interesting once the courtroom battle begins, Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson kick into high gear, and those pathetic Saving Private Ryan-wannabe battle scenes cease fire. It certainly feels like something downloaded from the creative mind of one TomÂ Clancy, with A Few Good Men tossed in for good measure. C+
