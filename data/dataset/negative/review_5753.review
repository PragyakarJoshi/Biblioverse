          Exciting? Yes.  Good story?  Yes.  Then what is my complaint?  It is the gratuitous gore.  Do the directors really have to show a pair of scissors, such as is used to cut twigs or small branches, while the gangsters cut off the fingers one by one of a suspected cheat?  His head is in the toilet and the blood is gushing all over the place.  I could have done with that.           Too bad because the story is a good thriller.  Two women (Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly), in an attempt to outwit the male Mobsters makes for an exciting film. The two, who happen to be Lesbians, against the gangsters tosses in another angle in mobster films.   But the film kept bugging me with all the shooting and blood and the aforementioned scissors and kept me from enjoying the film's story more.           An odd thing was the acting of Ceasar (sic) who seemed to be doing an imitation of Jack Nicholson right down to the whites in his eyeballs whenever he looked upward, a distinct Nicholson affectation.           I don't know whether or not I liked the film well enough to overcome the violence.  If that kind of mayhem does not bother you, you will enjoy the rest of the film.
