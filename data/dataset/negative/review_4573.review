     This should have been called "Too Long."  Not only was the two-hours film boring but it was entirely derivative and predictable. Everything that you have ever seen in a comedy film (good or bad) was thrown into this mess. When you see the comic hero (Antonio Banderas) running out of a house which has a pool, you know he is going to end up in it. Remember the famous scene in the Marx Bros. film where they are facing each other as if they were looking in a mirror?  That was a work of genius. This silly thing tried to imitate it with a variation that was just a poor imitation.      An art dealer/cum con man, Art (Dodge. . . is that a pun for Dickens' "Artful Dodger?") pretends he is a twin brother to Bart.  Both parts are played by Antonio Banderas.  As the twin, he lets his long hair down and puts on glasses.      The cast consists of well-known names.  Aside from Banderas, there is Melanie Griffith, Daryl Hannah, Joan Cusack, Danny Aiello and Joan Cusack.  What a waste of talent.      Question, when is Aiello going to refuse to play a mafia-type surrounded by bone-breaking bodyguards?  He has the talent but he has been typecast as an Italian gangster and apparently the money that part brings him overshadows the fact that he is a good actor and ought to insist that his agent find him a new role.
