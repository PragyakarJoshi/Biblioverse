     Dan Aykroyd and Daniel Stern are well-cast as a pair of rabid  Celtics fans who kidnap the opposing team's star player (Damon  Wayans) before the last game of a tied championship series.  They  make a good, goofy couple:  Stern as the gym-teaching, distracted  husband whose wife, once again, wants a divorce; Aykroyd as the  never-dates plumber with a head full of stats and an apartment full  of kitsch.  The movie, unfortunately, doesn't give the pair nearly  enough to do.  Their gags are too often air balls and the verbal  interplay-- between them and the sour-mouthed Wayans-- doesn't  score the way it should.  (To make matters worse, the distressingly  underwritten film is distressingly overscored by composer Basil  Poledouris.)   Sports fans should find this funny, but lay people  may want to lay off such a lame lay up.  Now, if only someone would  make a movie about rabid *ACC* fans...
