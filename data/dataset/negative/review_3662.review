     I hate to be blunt, but CLUELESS stinks.  It's a really bad movie on so many levels.  Think of CLUELESS as a FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH for the 90s for two reasons: they were both directed by Amy Heckerling and they both stink.  In a movie season so devoid of comedy, CLUELESS is not what we need, not now and not ever.      CLUELESS stars Alicia Silverstone as a pouty rich girl that no one watching this film should identify with or care about.  (By the way Alicia, you've got that pouting expression down pat, move on.)  She and her rich friends go through terrible troubles in this film such as hoping this guy likes me and wondering what to wear.  Oooooo.  Also, these kids talk like juvinile Dennis Miller clones without the humor. I'm 20 years old.  I graduated high school and even spent some time in college and no one I ever came across could use every word in the dictionary in a sentence.  So, we are supposed to believe that these brain dead, drinking, dope smoking, immature idiots who don't know their left from their right have time between shopping and grooming and partying and exercise routines to sit down and read the American Heritage Dictionary cover to cover??  Now that might be funny if they were using the words wrong, but in every occasion they are absolutely right.  I want anyone who talks like this or knows anyone who talks like this to drop me a line.      Back to the movie, CLUELESS is just awful.  Have I said that? Well, I can't stress it enough.  The worst thing for a comedy to be is unfunny, which is what CLUELESS is.  There is a laugh here and there, but I think I was laughing at things that weren't meant to be funny. And someone tell me if this film is supposed to be satire, because to me, there needs to be a normal character in this film to point out the satire.  Stay far, far away from CLUELESS.
