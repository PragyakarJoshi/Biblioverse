        WHAT ABOUT BOB? serves up Bill Murray's most delectable character, and performance, in a long, long time.  Murray is both funny and tender in the role of an obsessive-compulsive agoraphobe coming out of his shell. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast doesn't measure up: Richard Dreyfuss, as Bob's put-upon psychiatrist, is untypically uninspired--and Jill Hagerty (who plays Dreyfuss' cookie cutter wife) gives what will probably end up being the worst performance of the decade.         The first of the movie half zips along smoothly, but then, frustratingly, the film takes a disastrous nose dive.  Tom (DEAD POETS SOCIETY) Schulman's disappointing script becomes more and more contrived until--THUD--the movie ends with a painful belly flop.
