     Never say, "Watch this movie," to someone either. Not that anyone  said that to me. In fact, I wish someone had said the opposite to me. I  sat through two-plus hours of Sean Connery trying to pretend he was  still young enough to be James Bond, more than twenty years after  portraying 007 for the first time in DR. NO. His age makes the multiple  fistfights and love scenes with beautiful women more absurd-looking than  usual. I'd say the fact that six years later Sean Connery would start  playing action heros' fathers (INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE and  ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES) should clue you in on what I'm talking  about. Why Connery couldn't leave the legend as it was instead of  returning for the most bland Bond movie he's ever done is what puzzles  me. No, I don't ponder the mysteries of the universe and the mortality  of life. I ponder this for hours on end.       NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a remake of 1965's THUNDERBALL, one of the  more mediocre efforts from the Connery years. (Why they couldn't redo  GOLDFINGER or DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER is another thing I stay awake nights pondering.) It keeps the basic premise of that movie--villain  Largo, owner of an enormous yacht, steals two nuclear devices and  threatens their detonation on the world if a ransom is not met--but  changes almost everything else.       Bond is reactivated as a double-o agent, only to be shipped off to  a health farm to purge him of his ancient habits of eating red meat and  drinking martinis shaken not stirred (when it's so much better for your  body to have them stirred and not shaken). He does engage in a couple  other old habits of his--sex with his masseuse and a destructive fight  with a goon trying to kill him. He also stumbles upon the evil nurse  (Barbara Carrera) working for Largo. That's conquest number two for  Bond, who attracts beautiful women like flies... actually, mosquitoes  might be a better comparison when you think about it.       He then ends up playing a high-stakes video game with Largo (They  had to take advantage of that 80's technology.) and doing the tango  (vertically and horizontally) with Kim Basinger. Then there's the  motorcycle chase, laser watch, Carrera's combustion and endless scuba  diving. But it never seems like a full-fledged Bond movie. Besides the  fact that Connery is over the action hero hill, British inventor Q. is  played by a different actor and Moneypenny only has two lines. Wouldn't  you think if Connery aged twenty years since the first movie that  Moneypenny would be pushing fifty too? Nope, she's still unexplainably  thirtyish. That's something else I'll be pondering at great lengths  tonight.
