     There's a playful absurdity to SUDDEN DEATH that wouldn't be  out of place in a John Woo movie.  Sure, the plot--about a lone  fireman (Jean-Claude Van Damme) in a terrorist-held hockey rink-- is a rip-off of DIE HARD, but the over-the-top approach could have  come straight from Hong Kong.  Of course, director Peter Hyams  (TIMECOP) is no John Woo.  (Or, for that matter, even a Robert  Rodriguez.) He can't construct a tightly choreographed fist-fight  to save his life.  What Hyams *is* good at, though, is the *big*  stuff:  impressive aerial shots of the Pittsburgh Civic Arena,  surrounded on all sides by the flashing lights of emergency  vehicles.  Or the in-your-face hockey footage that is juxtaposed  through- out the film.  (The plot has the Vice President held  hostage during a Stanley Cup playoff.)      Hyams liabilities as a lean-and-mean action director are  evident in the very first scene.  Cut to a residential  neighborhood, where Van Damme's character, a Pittsburg firefighter,  is trapped inside a working house fire.  The short sequence is  staged with no more finesse than your average TV movie and that's a  sign for us.  We know, in those first few minutes, that the rest of  the action is going to be only OK.  Not great, just OK.  (The later  "oohs" and "aahs" you hear are from those who have never seen the  good stuff, such as John Woo's HARD TARGET, made with Van Damme in  1993.)      With the visceral impact diluted, the incentive to keep  watching comes from the honest humor--which is unusually generous  for a film of this sort--and the parody.  Or is it self-parody?   Who can tell where to draw the line after watching a free-for-all  kitchen brawl between Van Damme and a woman in a mascot suit?  When  a giant penguin tries to push our hero's head into a deep-fat  fryer, we know not to take things too seriously.  SUDDEN DEATH is  not a dumb movie, per se, but it is dumb fun.  So, relax and roll  with the punches.  After all, this *is* a hockey game.  (Rated  "R"/~110 min.) Michael J.
