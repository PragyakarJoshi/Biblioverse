      Before Trey Parker struck success with TV's "South Park," he made a dreadful, scatological, NC-17 satire of parasitic, hard-core pornography.  In this offensive opus, Parker plays a mild-mannered Mormon missionary who agrees to appear in a porno film with Ron Jeremy (a real-life porno star) in order to earn $20,000 so that he can be married in the temple in Salt Lake City. Reassured that there will be a "stunt penis" for penetration, he accepts the role of the XXX-rated superhero Orgazmo, who crashes through cardboard walls to rescue damsels who are being ravished by Jeremy. His secret weapon is his Orgazmorator which stuns his enemies with multiple orgasms. Meanwhile, his virginal fiancee (Robyn Lynne Raab) in Utah is curious about the film, so the missionary says it's "Death of a Salesman." Intrigued, she flies to Southern California, where she's soon kidnapped and tied to a bed by the unscrupulous, foul-mouthed film-maker (Michael Dean Jacobs).  The lame, shoddy, infantile excitement is confined to a huge German shepherd humping a man's leg and a gray-haired granny swearing like a Marine drill sergeant. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Orgazmo" is barely a 1. No yucks and a yawn - a dud.
