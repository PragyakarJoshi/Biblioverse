"Hanging Up" is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is the only one  I can think of that made me want to pull out a gun and start shooting at the  images onscreen. It's a horrible experience, as if somebody had discovered my  pet peeves and decided to devote a whole film to winding me up. Although I  own a cellphone and am acquainted with whiny women, they are both things I  detest, and for emergencies only. Watching them for 95 minutes is not my idea  of a good time. The film is supposed to be the story of a man's family reacting to his  descent into death. It's actually just an irritating bunch of phone  conversations between three witless sisters, who might actually develop  personalities if they cancelled their AT&T subscriptions and lived in the  real world. Meg Ryan plays Eve, the one who stays by her father's hospital  bed, deals with his eruptions of dementia, and calls up everyone else, trying  to get them to visit him. Maddy (Lisa Kudrow), the youngest sibling, is an  insecure little tramp who complains that nobody will take her seriously; she  doesn't think it odd that at age 29 she was still dreaming of becoming a rock  star, and in her mid-30s she expects she's going to be an actress. Georgia  (Diane Keaton), the eldest, is smarmy, dishonest and lies about her personal  life when it will bring her gain. So much of "Hanging Up" takes place on the phone, with the annoying trio  barking insipid platitudes down receivers, that when I left the cinema my  ears were still ringing from clicks, beeps and dial tones. Perhaps this movie  was inevitable, such is contemporary society's obsession with  telecommunication. Delia and Nora Ephron, who wrote the screenplay, and Diane  Keaton, the director, seem to think this presentation of people is normal,  and that's rather sad. Worse is the grating nature of the performances. Keaton plays her detestable  character with the kind of glee that shoves right into our faces and makes us  want to scream. Ryan is unconvincing, because she uses the same disorganised  comic presence as in "When Harry Met Sally" and "Joe Versus the Volcano", and  expects it to work when her character is supposed to be a cornerstone of  emotional stability. As for Lisa Kudrow, well, she's a joke, who exudes  stupidity from all of her phoney body, dead eyes, and flat, sarcastic whimper  of a voice. You know when you're on a crowded train, and you're wedged into the window  seat when three other people need to sit in the same booth as you? "Hanging  Up" is a lot like that, as long as the three people are vapid yuppie bitches  whining and crying about their boyfriends and families into mobile telephones  that play a little tune when they ring. This is a film that could get  Gandhi's blood boiling. If it becomes your wife's favourite video, no sane  jury will convict you of domestic abuse.
