     Bring together big stars George C. Scott, Rita Moreno, and Kathy Bates to do a feature film and what do you get?  A movie about a teenager named Angus, "the fat kid who's good at science and fair at football" and who just wants to be accepted.  What else would you expect?      While not really a "kids' movie," ANGUS is a workmanlike coming-of-age film, full of slapstick and insult trading among the youthful cast and their parents.  Angus is played by newcomer Charlie Talbert (who was discovered in a Wendy's restaurant).  Bates plays Mom, and Scott is Grandpa.  With the help of his nerdy friend Troy (Chris Owen), Angus chases after local beauty Melissa (JURASSIC PARK's Ariana Richards) and overcomes the obstacles placed before him by the requisite jock-bullies who are threatened by his being different.      A heavily tested formula, to say the least.  The predictability of ANGUS is mind-numbing, but thankfully it's pretty funny along the way, especially Scott's crusty grandfather (note that the humor may not be totally suitable for children).  But don't expect a lot of touching dialogue or an even remotely believable romance between Angus and Melissa; instead, between the jokes, just sit back and listen to 20 or 30 of your favorite pop hits, one after another.      In the end, the movie is humdrum, marginal eye candy--made of pure saccharine.  Take it or leave it, it's completely harmless and as filling as a packet of Sweet N Low. -Christopher Null  /  <A HREF="mailto:null@utxvms.cc.utexas.edu">null@utxvms.cc.utexas.edu</A> -Screenwriter & Novelist -Contributing Editor, Mike's FEEDBACK  /  Film Critic, Texas Business Weekly -[R]eply to be added to movie review mailing list
