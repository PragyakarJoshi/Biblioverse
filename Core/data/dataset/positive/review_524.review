     I always have a certain fear when I make recommendations for a movie.  I fantasize that one day I'll be sitting at my computer, tapping away on the keyboard, mumbling to myself, when suddenly I'll be snatched out of my chair by two meaty hands and lifted up until my feet are dangling in the air (which is even more frightening than it sounds, considering I'm six-foot-four), with my nose pressed into the face of some pre-hominid who has a face like a Rottweiler with a complexion problem.  I hear the voice of doom in my ears:  "ARE YOU DA GUY WHO TOLD ME TO GO WASTE MY TIME AND MONEY ON DA STUPIDEST MOVIE I EVER SEEN IN MINE LIFE?!"      And I'll forthrightly answer:  "Well ...  no ...  I'm just sitting here because he got a job in Piscataway and nobody's bothered to change the name plates on the desk yet ..."      Consider, for example, Weird Al Yankovic's new film, UHF.  Let me explain what it is about first before I make any further comments on it ...      George Newman (Weird Al hisself) is a chronic daydreamer who likes to create perverse fantasies from popular cinematic scenarios -- which results in some interesting footage for the viewer, but also gives him a problem with holding down a job.  Fired from a long list of menial jobs, George is getting ready to give up hope, when his gambler uncle wins a run-down UHF station, Channel 62, in an idle game of cards.  He doesn't know what to do with it, of course -- 62 is the worst station in the known Universe, and probably in most parallel dimensions as well -- but George's lively aunt has an idea:  Let George run the station!      George is a little discouraged in his work at first, but after a few lucky breaks, manages to bring Channel 62 to the top of the charts (with the help of some slightly unconventional programming).  This draws the wrath of RJ Fletcher, owner of Channel 8, the network affiliate station -- and RJ is immune to cancer because everything in his body is malignant to begin with.      Okay, 'nuff said, you got the idea.  Now for the comments:  UHF is a thrown- together film, working on a low budget, with little in the way of acting (Weird Al is certainly not Oscar material) or story (the plot is like a watered-down version of Mel Brook's SILENT MOVIE).  However, the only important criteria for judging a comedy is:  DID YOU LAUGH?  And the answer is: YES ... sometimes.      Make no mistake, UHF "dares to be stupid", and keeps it up from start to finish; it's like Weird Al is taking blind shots at you in hopes of hitting your funny bone -- and succeeding on occasion, though never to the point of getting on a roll.  Still, when there are yuks, they're good ones.      I liked this film, though I can't say I feel extremely enthusiastic about it.  Will you like it?  The answer to that question is probably the same as the answer to this one:  Do you enjoy reading a MAD magazine from cover to cover?      And if I steered you wrong, don't come looking in Corvallis -- I'll be in Piscataway ...
