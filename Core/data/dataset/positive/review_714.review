     Horror films tend to be very derivative.  They take many of the same themes and rework them over and over.  How different is FRIGHT NIGHT from DRACULA really?  It is very rare for me to come out of a horror film feeling I had seen something really new for the horror film.  And, be warned, usually when I feel have seen something new, most audiences do not like the films.  In the last ten years there have been five horror films I have liked in this way.  They are SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES, LIFEFORCE, PRINCE OF DARKNESS, LADY IN WHITE, and now FLATLINERS.  FLATLINERS is a mesmerizing horror thriller about life and death and redemption.  From about two minutes into the film I was constantly anxious to find out what happens next.  And when it did happen, I was never disappointed but still never appeased.      A group of medical students are fascinated by the  brink-of-death experience that some of their patients have had.  But their curiosity certainly goes beyond just collecting other peoples' accounts second-hand. As long as they have the ability to induce death and to bring people back, why wait for it to happen by chance and to other people.  Why not go off exploring the undiscovered country for themselves.  As one student says of the quest to know what is beyond death, "Philosophy failed.  Religion failed.  Now it's time for medical science to try."  So one tries it and is brought back  But now things seem different to him and reality is not quite the same.      At least in theme FLATLINERS is reminiscent of some of the classic old Karloff films like Michael Curtiz's THE WALKING DEAD, and where that film was a little pat in its description of life after death (Karloff just had time to describe it as "peace" before dying a second time, and more permanently), this film is only a little less pat in other ways in its "meaning of death."  However, it is not concentrating so much on what the other side looks like as on what it is like to have been there and be back.      This is a movie to see in a theater; it will lose a lot of its visual impact on the small screen.  Almost the entire film is shot in either twilight half-tones or at night.  The medical school has got to be the most baroque in the world.  It would have done credit to any 1930s expressionistic horror film.  Its architecture is almost gothic with immense vaulting rooms; dark, dismal corridors; labs with immense statue heads as if gods were looking on.  Director Joel Schumacher's previous THE LOST BOYS had little to recommend it but atmosphere.  This time he has better atmosphere and a far more compelling story to tell.      Kiefer Sutherland (of LOST BOYS) plays Nelson, who is exploring death partially for curiosity and partially for glory.  Julia Roberts is Rachel, who has her own private demons to face.  Roberts has the best developed character.  Keith Bacon is Davis, who is just a little too good to be true. Alec Baldwin's younger brother William plays Joe, whose story is somewhat less interesting than the others and could by itself have been an episode of "The Hitchhiker."      FLATLINERS is intelligently filmed and written.  It has irony but happily not apparently tongue-in-cheek.  In short, it deserves to be a classic horror film and may well make it.  I rate it a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.
