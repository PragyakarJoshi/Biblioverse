     With HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE, first time writer/director Robert Townsend creates a very entertaining film.  This good-natured parody of movie-making gets most of its laughs from gentle but well-aimed shots at the stereotypes connected to black actors and white film makers.  Along the way HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE takes time out to lampoon hard-boiled detectives, Eddie Murphy, TV movie critics and the rewards of stardom.      Townsend also stars as Bobby, a struggling young black actor who works part-time at the local "Winky Dinky Dog" hot dog stand.  Bobby is trying out for his first movie role playing a street hood named Jivetime Jimmy. Unfortunately while Bobby hopes this part will put him on the road to stardom, he also feels the role is so absurdly unrealistic in its portrayal of blacks that to take the part would be selling out his integrity.      The best scenes in HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE take place in Bobby's mind, as he daydreams and images the consequences of his actions.  The tone of these scenes ranges from a dry Pythonisque humor to absurd visual humor that would be at home in one of the "Airplane" movies.      With the exception of Bobby's family and girlfriend, the other characters are caricatures of actors, producers, and hog dog vendors, but these caricatures are not presented in a mean-spirited way.  You are left with the feeling that Townsend is spoofing the stereotypes, not poking fun at the people associated with the stereotypes.      An intelligent comedy, and an effective parody, HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE rates a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale.
