      Richard Walker (played by Harrison Ford) is in Paris for a medical  convention.  He banters with his wife on the way to the hotel, checks in,  and takes a shower.  When he comes out of the shower his wife seems to have  stepped out.  Room service brings in an ordered breakfast and Walker eats  it and takes a nap.  When he wakes up, still no wife.  He goes to the lobby  to look for her.  One by one, he checks out possibilities of what could  have happened to her.  Soon his worst fears are confirmed.  He learns that  she has been kidnapped.  The police are surly; the American authorities can  do nothing.  Walker has to take matters into his own hands.  This is not  too original a plot and, in truth, much of FRANTIC has a ring of  familiarity.  In some ways it follows the classic style of a Hitchcock  thriller.  The one-word title, the innocent bystander hero, a genuine  McGuffin, even rooftop struggles.  Where it strays from being Hitchcockian  is in its nearly humorless approach and its cold-fish hero.  Harrison Ford  is nowhere near a personable one as a Cary Grant or a James Stewart.  That  makes the acting a few steps closer to reality, but the viewer is left to  guess what the character must be feeling rather than feeling with the  character.  We are drawn to Harrison Ford, but at arm's length.  With  Hitchcock and the right actor we would actually be living the adventure  with the character.  On the other hand, with most Hitchcock films it would  be easier to pick holes in the plot.  Even a VERTIGO has a plot that  entirely hinges on a man recognizing a specific Spanish villa from a  description from somebody's dream.  Following the initial events that set  the action of FRANTIC in motion, events follow a suspenseful but logical  course.  (The major unexplained point of the film is how an action that was  not intended to be a kidnapping--and seemingly could easily have avoided  being turned into one--was so botched.)       Ford's search for his missing wife takes him to, if not Paris's  underbelly, at least somewhere below Paris's waist.  His best clue leads  him to Michelle, a sinuous drugged punker played by Emmanuelle Seigner, who  provides a somewhat less innocent bystander to the plot and provides the  attractive female lead required in any Roman-Polanski-directed film.  As a  cliche-buster, however, Walker reacts with total disinterest to Michelle's  attempts at seduction.  First, last, and always, he is in this to get back  his wife (played by Betty Buckley, who played a sympathetic teacher in  CARRIE, a sympathetic mother in EIGHT IS ENOUGH, and an unsympathetic  singer in TENDER MERCIES).       FRANTIC is a surprisingly straightforward thriller from director and  co-scripter Roman Polanski, who is usually known for for more convoluted  and psychological storylines.  Rate it a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.
