     MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE is, without a doubt, the finest movie based upon a line of toys that I have ever seen.  While you digest what that means, let me go on in more detail.      A curious mix of low-budget production techniques and high-tech Richard Edlund effects, the film comes off sort of like a production in search of a story.  The director was apparently distracted by the logistics of the rather ambitious effects, and the actors seem to have been left more or less on their own.  Dolph Lungren has very little to do as He-Man but flex.  Billy Barty, who still looks like Billy Barty even under a lot of very good makeup appliances, has little to do but provide the regularly scheduled comic relief.      Frank Langella, as the evil Skeletor, manages to rise above the material. He is practically buried under his skull-like makeup, (which holds up impressively well under long, tight shots), and still manages to command every scene he's in.  Another high point is the casting of Meg Foster as Evil-Lyn (can you believe these names?) who is best when she just uses those amazing eyes of hers on the camera.      If you are enough of a special effects freak to subscribe to CINEFEX then you might want to see the film for some of Edlund's more imaginative sequences. Otherwise you should probably stay away unless dragged there by your kids. Beware before bringing the kinder: in a bone-headed move, they have a police character who says things like "Holy sh*t."  In a kid's movie?  Who was manning the bridge that day?  That, along with the laser whip scene (one of the niftier effects), probably got them their PG rating.  I give it $2.00 on a scale of $5.00.
