     Chris is a high school senior from the suburbs of Chicago.  After her boyfriend breaks their date, she agrees to baby-sit the Anderson's little girl. Soon after the parents leave, Chris gets a call from her best friend, Brenda. Brenda ran away, made it to the downtown bus station before her money and resolve ran out, and wants Chris to drive into the city to pick her up.  The little girl and her love-struck brother blackmail Chris into taking them and the brother's best friend along with her.  They climb into Chris's mother's car, and head for the bus station.      A flat tire, a missing spare, and a forgotten purse leave them stranded and broke in a city that seems to be one large unfamiliar and threatening slum. Chris's task is clear: she must fix the car, evade the murderous auto-theft czar, and get the children home before Mom and Dad get back from the party.      ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING borrows heavily from RISKY BUSINESS, AFTER HOURS, and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF.  It is amusing with some genuinely funny moments, but it's all been done before.  Another problem is director Chris Columbus, writer of GREMLINS and GOONIES.  He paints this movies cute with a wide brush: childhood innocence melts the hearts of hardened city toughs, help is found in the most unlikely of places, and the kids learn about people and about their own abilities.  The result has cloying sticky-sweet feel that will disappoint anyone over the age of 14.      ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING does have its moments; the appearance by blue legend Albert Collins is almost worth the ticket price.  But there are so many decent comedies out this summer, that unless you've seen everything else it would be best to wait until ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING hits cable.
