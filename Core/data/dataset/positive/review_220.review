     This new film is a fabulous stream-of-consiousness riff by Robin Williams surrounded by a remarkably dull war story.  It is supposed to be based on a real-life 60s army radio MC, but it does no good to know that.  Perhaps the war story is something on which he insisted.  I saw the movie a week ago, and now I believe the purpose of the silly story is to give the audience time to relax their mouths and cheeks, and catch some breath, as breathing is hard when you're laughing as much as you do while Mr.  Williams is working.      A couple of years ago Mr.  Williams rented the Metropolitan Opera House (which seats 3,718 people) and performed an intimate monologue there.  During that show he occasionally became less funny.  But breathing was an obstacle. Both for him (he speaks so fast I have doubts as to how he inhales at all) and for the audience (we were rolling in the aisles.)  I believe it was filmed for TV.  That might be the best way to see him, with the less funny material edited out, and a remote control so one can stop it every once in a while and respire.      But this film has enough of Mr.  Williams being funny to make it worth the $7 (I think I paid $30 for the Met) and enough fluff to leave time to breath.
