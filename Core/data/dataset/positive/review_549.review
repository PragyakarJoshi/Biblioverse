     The structure of this film is largely in the form of a flash back which takes place in 1974 at the time of Nixon's resignation.  The flashback itself is based on an incident which took place in 1966 and was subsequently written up in New Yorker in 1969.      The film is a somewhat different film compared to many of the plastic coated comedies, light hearted dramas, and big budget shoot them movies of most summer far.  This film tries to be an accounting of one event during the war.      I went to see this film because I, as many curious, wondered how Michael Fox would do in dramatic role.  I think he does well.  I did have the reservations that this was another Vietnam era film where by Vets would come out looking crazy or half deranged.  This being a problem with many of the films including PLATOON and COMING HOME.  Direction was provided by Brian DePalma.      I think the film does a reasonably good job.  It is not highly insane like the allegory of the DEER HUNTER or APOCALYPSE NOW.  On the other hand this wasn't quite Platoon or Full Metal Jacket.  The film does end on kind of an upbeat note, definitely positive, I would hope that vets haven't walked out of the theater by this time.  The investigation did take place, and people brought to "justice."      The film starts with Erickson (Fox) on a subway.  Nixon's resigning (paper) when a Vietnamese girl steps on the Muni (SF).  He flashback (sweaty). The film goes to confusion of a night patrol and ambush.  Fox falls into a tunnel entrance and gets stuck (I know some one who fell into a North Korean tunnel and survived).  This whole section is good.  We see Fox has a good Sargent.      The next day on a search during lunch.  The Sarge (played by Penn) is standing with one of his buddies when a sniper hits the buddy.  A short firefight ensues.  There is one scene when a VC jumps into a tunnel in sight (a little improbable, but it conveys the impression).  These guys don't trust the villagers.      The next assignment has them going on long range recon.  It is during this that Penn decides to abduct the girl.  A new grunt (Diaz) has no idea what's going on ("Is this usual?").  They bring her along on the patrol where they rape her.  Diaz tells Erickson he won't go along, but in the end does.  The argument with the Sarge is a moderately powerful statement of "Going along" [much better than DEAD POET'S SOCIETY].      The next day, the patrol located a VC cache, they call in an fire mission which also happens to waste a River Boat (friendly fire).  It is during this that Erickson has a chance to free the girl (unsuccessfully).  The Sarge decides to waste the girl, at which time Erickson draws VC attention (this is actually just prior to the fire mission).  This all takes place at once.  They end up shooting the girl.      After they return to their base.  Erickson just misses a fragging.  His officers won't listen to him, only one buddy will.  His Lt breaks the squad up. During another patrol, Erickson and one buddy are talking when a new man who has been bugging them steps on a mine.  This is the moral climax of the film where he decides to tell.  He goes to the Capt.  Also no show.  I won't spoil the solution.      In the end, an investigation locates the body of the girl, the four are court martialed and the flashback ends with the Sarge whispering something into Erickson's ear.      Flash back ends.  Short interesting conclusion.      The film does have its holes and bad points: one of Erickson's comrades is just a bit too homicidal, and the officers perhaps a bit too "don't rock the boat."  One does wonder what is whispered.  One does wonder if the Sarge is out in the world (sentence is over by now).  Does he want pay back?      The film does portray combat well (confusion, waste, the there one-minute, gone the next).  It is just one incident.  Fox does portray a character who is somewhat naive and "goody-two shoes."  I won't numerically rate it.  It is also hard to say you "enjoy" this type of film.  It's not clear how a viewer might place themselves (if they would be an Erickson, or a Sarge, or even better a Diaz).  But it is a change from the lighter films of the summer.  There's no purely evil character.  They are all victims.  I do think the film is worth seeing. --eugene miya, NASA Ames Research Center, <A HREF="mailto:eugene@aurora.arc.nasa.gov">eugene@aurora.arc.nasa.gov</A>   {ncar,decwrl,hplabs,uunet}!ames!eugene
