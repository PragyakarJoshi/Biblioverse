     SUMMARY:  MAURICE tells the story of a platonic love affair between Maurice Hall and his Cambridge classmate Clive Durham which took place when homosexuality was still a criminal offense in England.  Under societal pressures to conform, Clive tries to suppress his love for Maurice and marries a [dull] upper-class woman.  Maurice also tries to suppress his attraction for men but eventually  comes to term with his feelings and casts aside the homophobic and  class-divisive values of his society.        MAURICE is quite a bit more exciting than the above summary suggests. It's a fantasy romance with elements of a grim reality, the cruel persecution of gay love.  Maurice Hall is outwardly an ordinary man, an upstanding member of wealthy English society, as is Clive Durham.  But they share a secret.   Each loves the other.  Maurice has been attracted to men as long as he can remember, but he was never able to discuss these feelings with anyone because the teachers & clergymen constantly tell their wards about the  "unspeakable sin of the Greeks" and watched them constantly.  It is by  accident that Maurice meets Clive at Cambridge.  Their friendship blossoms and the two fall in love but for a long time, neither is capable of acknowledging his emotion for the other.        The movie succeeds beautifully in capturing the moods of romantic love, the wistful longing glances, the words almost-but-not-quite spoken.  The  interior settings are rich with period details and everything radiates warmth. The outdoor settings are equally romantic.  The fields and woods always appear green, lush and misty.  Clive's country estate possessed a dignified, timeless  charm as filmed by director James Ivory.  The costuming was equally flawless, as with A ROOM WITH A VIEW, the previous film by the Merchant-Ivory producer- director team.      The most interesting part of the movie's storyline, for me, involves the two paths taken by Clive and Maurice in response to the trial of their mutual  friend, Lord Risley.  Entrapped by a policeman, Risley was sent to hard labor for committing a homosexual "offense."  Clive becomes ill with worry and fear and eventually breaks off his affair with Maurice to marry a woman and enter a  career in politics.  These changes, however, are nothing more than monumental acts of self-deception for Clive.  Maurice also tries to conform.  He goes to  a hypnotist who tries to "cure" him of his "sickness."  Maurice eventually comes to accept his gay sexual identity and ends up the happier for it.      James Wilby turns in a convincing performance as the torn Maurice.   This role was originally to be played by Julian Sands, who played George in A ROOM WITH A VIEW.  I think James Wilby's appearance is more suited for the role of the "ordinary" man which Maurice is.  Julian Sands would have been too "pretty."  Hugh Grant plays dashing Clive Durham and manages to effectively communicate the pathetic changes that occur in Clive (keep track of who has the mustache :-) ).  The supporting cast is generally amusing.  Ben Kingsley puts in a appearance as the American hypnotist.      MAURICE presents a positive, idealized view of gay love in comparison to the grim depiction of a gay marriage in PRICK UP YOUR EARS.  The author, E. M. Forster, wrote it with a happy ending in mind, with the idea that "two men should fall in love and remain in it for the ever and ever that fiction allows" and said that he "shouldn't have bothered to write otherwise."  The story's main weakness is the contrivedness of some of the meetings.  (re: Maurice & Alec)   I enjoyed the movie a great deal and found these faults to  be minor. As a matter of fact, I'll probably go back to see it *again* soon, which is my way of saying "this is one of the best movies I've seen this year."
