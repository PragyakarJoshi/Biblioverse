     INNERSPACE retells the FANTASTIC VOYAGE story, this time going for, and getting, laughs.  Dennis Quaid plays Tuck Pendelton, a washed-up fighter pilot with an ego the size of a truck.  He is to man the first miniaturized exploration of a living animal.  When the experiment is interrupted by industrial spies, Pendelton is accidentally injected into the rear end of Jack Putter, a Safeway clerk played by Martin Short.  Putter is a nervous hypochondriac whose ego is as under-developed as Tuck's is over-inflated.      Putter, with the help of Tuck's reporter girlfriend, must recover the stolen microchip needed to reenlarge Tuck, before Tuck's air supply runs out. They are chased by villains reminiscent of a James Bond film, captured by rival scientists, and threatened by orange-haired grocery shoppers.      INNERSPACE takes the elements of a typical adventure thriller, adds some snappy dialogue and good special effects, and skillfully creates a very entertaining movie.  More than once the whole theater was laughing out loud. Dennis Quaid described INNERSPACE as "a dumb, stupid comedy...and I love it. We encounter every dumb, stupid cliche in the book.  Leave your brain at home and you'll have a good time."  I took my brain along, and thought INNERSPACE was great.
