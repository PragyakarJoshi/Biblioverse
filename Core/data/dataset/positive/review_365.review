     David Cronenberg doesn't make "easy" films.  He made the best ever Stephen King movie, THE DEAD ZONE, and THE FLY was one of the best films of 1986.  The latter was, in many circles, maligned or simply ignored just because it was a "horror" film.  Hmph.  Beneath the goo, glop and prosthetics was a psychological thriller.  Now Cronenberg brings us DEAD RINGERS, a pure psycho-thriller.  He proves that what *really* frightens you is in your mind, not your eye.      Steve Upstill observed that this film shows a whole new level of maturity for Cronenberg.  His direction is deft, sure and polished.  There isn't a note out of place.  His sense of visual style, so striking in THE FLY, has evolved into a subtle, strong support for the story.  While giving Jeff Goldblum and Jeremy Irons the tremendous credit that is their due, I cannot help but wonder if it's entirely a coincidence that they each turned in such amazing performances under the same director.      Irons is simply drop-dead stunning in his dual role as the Mantle twins. Beverly and Eliot are brilliant gynecologists with a successful fertility clinic.  They are identical twins; so identical that they can share everything: patients, business appointments, and women.  Irons, who you may remember from THE MISSION, has such a firm grasp of these complex characters that you can often tell within the first few seconds of a scene which twin is which.  Aided by a seamless, perfectly-executed motion control split-screen system -- and by Cronenberg -- Irons does work worthy of the *two* Academy Awards for which he should be nominated.  By the end of the film it's difficult to think of him as just one man.  He is supported by the always fabulous Genevieve Bujold, in her role as the infertile, promiscuous actress.      You've noticed by now that I haven't talked about the story.  That's because I hate spoilers in reviews.  Let me just encourage you to go to what is a strong contender for my top ten list this year.  But let me do it with a warning:  DEAD RINGERS is an intense psychological experience.  It is disturbing and tragic.  Nobody can give you the creeps like Cronenberg.  There are images and feelings which will stay with you for quite a while.  If you insist on leaving the theatre singing a merry song you should steer clear.  If you like being engrossed, awed, repulsed, frightened and skillfully manipulated then make tracks to the movie house.
