     Joan Micklin Silver's CROSSING DELANCY is a gem that should be cherished by filmgoers.  One doesn't want to overpraise a film like this because it deserves to be enjoyed as one would a light dessert.  It is not a heavy cinematic feast, but a delightful romantic truffle.      Isabelle (Amy Irving) is a modern career woman of thirty-three living in Manhattan.  She is fulfilled by her work, has terrific friends but is unattached romantically.  However, she is not "holding her breath" waiting for "Mr. Right"; she is perfectly comfortable without a man in her life.  Her grandmother (Reizl Bozyk) has other ideas.  She hires a marriage broker (Sylvia Miles) to find a husband for Issy.  What ensues is a clash between Issy's modern way of life and the traditional values of her grandmother.      Micklin Silver has pitched the film perfectly.  It is sweet and sentimental without being saccharine; it is wise and funny without being preachy or silly.  Each scene is packed with wit and warmth.  These characters seem real.  The humor is the humor of everyday life and not contrived sitcom shenanigans.  Susan Sandler is credited with the wondrous screenplay.      The acting is exceptional.  Irving is perfect in the lead but the show stealers are Bozyk as her grandmother and Miles as the marriage broker.  Miles literally chews the scenery and is hilarious.  Look for these two when the year-end award nominations are announced.
