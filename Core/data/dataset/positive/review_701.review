     Who's Dick Tracy?  I don't know.  About the only thing I know about Dick is he has a radio wristwatch, and doesn't he have a secret decoder ring?  Or is that Captain Crunch?      Anyway, I didn't have a lot of preconceived notions about Dick Tracy when I went to see it.  I'd seen the previews, and they looked OK, but there wasn't the same level of anticipation as for BATMAN.  Maybe Dick's a character for another generation.  He's certainly not a big part of mine.      I was definitely impressed with the show.  Warren Beatty plays a great Dick Tracy, right down to the yellow overcoat and hat.  Madonna turned in what has got to be one of the best performances of her film career.  The woman radiated sex.  I was certainly surprised to see her in the ending.  My guess as to the real identity of No-Face was way out in left field.  Justifiable, but not on the mark.  Al Pacino was superb as the gangster Big Boy Caprice.  His constant little "quotes" by famous people were a nice touch.      All of the smaller parts were done well too.  88 Keys (Mandy Patinkin), Flattop, Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman), and the rest of the disfigured criminal elements were right on the mark.  My impression was that everybody was having a lot of fun with the part, and played them to the hilt.  Tess Trueheart (Glenn Headly) turned in a good performance as Tracy's girlfriend, and the Kid provided a light touch of humor. Rating:      Classy stuff.  The comic book-like use of color, the make-up,      the sets were all very well done.  Given my lack of familiarity      with the history of Dick Tracy, it was still easy to follow the      movie, except for trying to remember all the gangster names.      But if you can picture the face, you can probably remember the      name.  Great acting, an okay plot, good makeup, and nice special      effects earn this one a 4 stars (****,excellent) out of 4.
