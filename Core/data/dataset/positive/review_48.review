Starring: Esai Morales, Rosana DeSoto, Elizabeth Pena, Joe Pantoliano,            Lou Diamond Phillips Music by: Carlos Santana and Miles Goodman Director of Photography: Adam Greenberg Executive Music Producer: Joel Sill Executive Producer: Stuart Benjamin Produced by: Taylor Hackford and Bill Borden Written and Directed by: Luis Valdez      Luis Valdez (ZOOT SUIT) has crafted a lively, earthy, fond remembrance of  Richard Valenzuela, who became famous as Ritchie Valens ("it could have been  Richie Zuela").  Starting with the return of his wayward older step-brother,  the Valenzuelas move into the Los Angeles area, and Richard finds an audience  for his singing and playing, moving briefly on to fame and fortune.  Does  anyone besides me not know what happened to Ritchie Valens?      This is a picture that works on a number of levels.  First, the story is (apparently) an accurate portrayal of the life of Ritchie Valens.  Second, the story is engrossing as cinema; a moving, motivated tale of the trials and tribulations of people who must face life with courage and dignity.  Finally, this is a stirring celebration of the success of the music of the Fifties and  of the cultural influences that shaped, at least, part of it.         I must credit the actors with an exceptional job.  I am not familiar with any of the actors and actresses, which made it easy to avoid feeling that I was watching a familiar actor play yet *another* part, but I never got the feeling that I was watching some less-than talented performer stone-face through a portrayal on the strength of a physical match.  Without exception, the  characters were believable and sympathetic.  In the only character portrayal I can attribute, Lou Diamond Phillips captures Ritchie Valens as a talented, committed young man with senses of both humor and duty.  Also worth mentioning are the performances of Valens' older step-brother, girl-friend, mother, and agent.  In particular, Ritchie's older brother alternates between bouts of good-natured hedonism and frustrated anger without slipping into bathos or  pathos.        As might be expected, the music is exceptional.  I was only aware of Ritchie Valens as a predecessor and influence on the band Los Lobos (aside from being familiar with his greatest hit "La Bamba"), but was pleasantly surprised to find that I greatly enjoyed all his songs.  While I am very fond of Los Lobos, I wasn't aware that they had performed all of his songs until the movie was over (they also appear as the mariachi band that Ritchie hears play the title song on his adventurous trip to Tijuana).  The film also consists of a succession of some of the classic songs of the fifties.  Carlos Santana also had a hand in the music, according to the credits.        To sum up, great music, good acting, and an interesting story make LA BAMBA not only a good movie, but a good time.  I'd give it a +2 on the Leeper -4 to  +4 scale.   Clark N.
