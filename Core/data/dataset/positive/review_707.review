Cast:  Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, Whoopi Goldberg      Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) and Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) have just  renovated a loft and moved into it.  Sam is an investment banker, Molly is a ceramicist.  They're a nice couple; they seem to balance each other in a satisfying way.  Very much in love, they're entering a deeper phase of commitment which is rudely interrupted by a mugger who kills Sam in front of Molly.  Sam watches over his own death and is as horrified as Molly, especially since he finds he's incapable of comforting her.      As we watch him follow Molly and watch over her in his old, uhm, haunts, (sorry, couldn't resist...) we feel his frustration and depression.  Demi Moore can look so vulnerable that the audience joins Sam in wanting to put an arm around her.  One day when she goes out for a walk, Sam remains in the loft and discovers that his mugging wasn't an accident: he was murdered.  Worse, he recognizes that Molly is in--yes, you've guessed it--"grave" danger, and he must find a way to protect her.      In desperation, Sam goes to the storefront business of Oda Mae (Whoopi Goldberg), a con artist whose latest con is spiritual advising. No one is more surprised than Oda Mae when she does actually hear a voice from beyond.  Therein starts the comic combination that develops into a truly entertaining set of scenes.  Goldberg plays this role with such relish that we willingly go along for the ride.        Sam pesters Oda Mae until she reluctantly agrees to talk with Molly, but convincing Molly of Sam's ghost turns into a very difficult project not at all aided by the fact that Oda Mae has one hell of a police record for swindling.  Sam, meanwhile, needs to find out who was in charge of his murder.  While pursuing his mugger, Sam is terrorized by a ghost on one of the subways.  This ghost can affect the real world in a way that Sam can't.  Eventually, Sam learns a thing or two from an old ghost.        The rest of the film shows Sam having an increased effect on the real world, and there's no way I'll tell you in advance what happens. Now for a look at the style of this film: what worked and what didn't?      The humor works.  It develops organically from the situation and the characters, and it's a necessary component in this film.  Although a local critic felt that the film bounced too much between being a romance and being lighthearted, I can't agree with the criticism.  If it weren't for the humor, the film would slip into pure sap without style.  As previously mentioned, Goldberg plays her part with gusto, and Swayze is as believable a ghost as I've ever, uhm, seen.      The music works, as you've probably already surmised by previous comments in the rec.arts.movies group.  Unchained Melody always seemed a sentimental piece that I liked for its pure romanticism.  Now I'll think of it and this movie as a unit.      The performances work: they were nearly perfect for this movie. I'm not usually a fan of Swayze, but as someone else on the net pointed out, he's a very physical kind of actor, and he did a fine job.  After you see this movie, try to imagine someone else playing Sam Wheat.  I can't think of anyone who'd be better here.  Demi Moore also is irreplaceable in this film.  She maintains a very sweet sadness throughout the film, entirely believable, entirely appropriate.  It's only when you consider that she spent 6/7ths of the movie with tears rolling down her face that you realize her role didn't have much meat. She managed very well.  And I've already expressed delight with Whoopi Goldberg.  No one else could have played her role as well as she.      The special effects work most of the time.  However, I'm not convinced that it was necessary to show us the difference between being sucked up by good ghosts vs. bad ghosts; it looked downright corny to me.  Another complaint: one of the special effects (toward the end) was gruesome.  I'm less willing to forgive that.  I firmly believe that explicit violence and comedy are mutually exclusive.        The ending was, I suppose, a natural consequence of the preceding events, but it seemed a trite too silly and it tried a bit too hard to tug at the heartstrings.  (For anyone who's interested, I've been thinking of alternative endings, and  I'd be interested in exchanging email about it.)        All in all, though, this was an entertaining movie that makes me miss movies about people and the connections between them.  It's not a "statement" movie, so you probably won't go home a better person :-), but you'll probably enjoy at least the love scenes between Sam and Molly and the humorous scenes between Sam and Oda Mae.  And maybe you too will find the old-fashioned idea of eternal love a compelling notion.
