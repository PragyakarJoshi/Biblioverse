     There's certainly nothing new in the plot behind MYSTIC PIZZA:  Three girls working as waitresses in a pizza parlor in Mystic, Connecticut, and their romantic entanglements during the summer and fall of one year.  One is just on the edge of matrimony with a fisherman, but can't quite cross the line; another, a vivacious local who wants to leave Mystic and gets involved with a rich out-of-towner; and her younger sister, about to go to Yale and falling in love with a married man.      However, the film makes its mark from the first shot with its infectious sense of humor and the collection of local characters it showcases.  The actors are given dialogue they can really get laughter out of, and they soon have developed characters who you are like quite a bit (especially the three lead actresses).  Finally, not all of the plot is cut-and-dried -- I was surprised several times with where the plot headed, and for those points where it wheeled around predictably, it did so with style and enthusiasm which belayed the cliche situations.      A good full-price film, and something of a surprise.  The Mystic Pizza in MYSTIC PIZZA resembles the film; the elements aren't revolutionary, but they're full-bodied and the mixture is just right.
