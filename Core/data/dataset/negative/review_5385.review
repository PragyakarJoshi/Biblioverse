     If you don't mind the sickly sentimental streak, an obviously bloated running time, and an exceptional lack of comic timing, then this Amish bowling comedy is, uh, right up your alley.  Directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly, who made DUMB AND DUMBER, could have retitled this one GROSS AND GROSSER.  No joke is too low for these guys.  With its endless references to semen, urine, vomit, and bowel movements, KINGPIN plays like a potty-mouthed update of THE COLOR OF MONEY.  Woody Harrelson is the pro, a one-time, one-handed bowling legend who spies an Amish lad (Randy Quaid) with the Gift.  The plot puts them on the road to Reno, where they have to hustle to pay for gas, beer, and other necessities. Despite the numerous laugh-out-loud moments, as well as a couple of classic sight gags, KINGPIN suffers from an absolute lack of momentum. (You might even fall asleep in the slower second half.) The timing is off in most places and the movie has an annoying habit of calling attention to it's own jokes.  No subtlety here, but, then again, how many other summer movies would dare put Randy Quaid in drag, on stage at a strip club, impersonating Elizabeth Berkley?
