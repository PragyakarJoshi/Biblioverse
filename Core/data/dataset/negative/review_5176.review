        No movie critic worth his fat wouldn't give this Alfred  Hitchcock masterpiece a four-star rating. I appreciated it even more  after seeing the three sequels (look down for reviews of those). I  just wish I hadn't known every little secret of this movie's plot before  seeing it. I can only imagine how much I would have liked PSYCHO  without knowing beforehand the details about Norman Bates and  his mother.         And if you haven't seen PSYCHO yet, forget about being  surprised when you find out Norman's been dressing up as his dead  mother and committing the murders himself. Hey, someone ruins it  for me, I ruin it for someone else.         The set-up: A beautiful (by 1960 standards) secretary is  entrusted with taking $40,000 to the bank. She bypasses the bank  and heads home instead, where she packs and skips town. The guilt  gets to her, though, and when night falls, she makes one final (fatal)  mistake--checking into the Bates Motel. Shoot, even I wouldn't  check into a motel with an outdoor sign reading "Color TV, Heated  Pool, Round-the-Clock Stabbings."         Norman's mom is a little jealous of this beautiful woman  stealing Norman's attention, so once she hits the shower, mama  comes down with a kife and... well, wouldn't want to give _too_  much away. Needless to say, the shower scene is one of the most  memorable in cinematic history, even more memorable than the fat,  vomiting guy in MONTY PYTHON'S THE MEANING OF LIFE. And don't forget the three lackluster sequels... PSYCHO II (1983) **1/2         That psycho Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) is back  again, fresh out of the asylum in this, the first of three sequels to  the 1960 Hitchcock classic. Bates is given a job in a diner as the  cook's assistant (You've gotta be crazy to work in a diner!), where  he meets an attractive young waitress with no place to stay. Say, I  do believe I can recommend a place. Why not the Bates Motel? Yes,  Norman takes the girl back to his old digs, but changes his mind  when he finds the manager has turned the Bates into a dive for  fornicating druggies. Norman protests, saying he won't stand for  such immorality. Why, he remembers the good old days, when the  Bates Motel was a place for peeping toms to watch women taking  showers and later stab them to death.         After firing the manager, Norman and the waitress head  up to the ramshackle Bates mansion, which now has no trace of  "mother." Norman tries hard to be sane, but how can he when he  keeps getting notes and phone calls from mommy dearest? As the  girl stays a few more nights (they're platonically shacked-up, you  might say), Norman begins to relapse. Soon, the old hotel manager  turns up dead and guess who they point the finger at. The man  dressed up as an old woman carrying on both sides of a  conversation with his mother? No, the waitress.         PSYCHO II is by no means on the same level as the  original (God rest its soul), but it's better than most horror movies  with a Roman numeral II in the title, including the second Friday  the 13th, Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre,  Nightmare on Elm Street and CHILD'S PLAY movies.  Still, Norman Bates has to be the wimpiest horror movie killer  ever. PSYCHO III (1986) *1/2         What's that sound I hear? Oh, that's just Alfred Hitchcock  turning over in his grave. Yes, Norman Bates is up to his old (yawn)  tricks again. He's been exonerated for all that went on in the second  PSYCHO and is trying to make an honest living in the motel  business. But he's set off again by a woman, this time a guilty  ex-nun (the best-looking nun I've ever seen) who bears a striking  resemblance to Norman's first shower victim from the original  PSYCHO.         Also along for the ride this time are Norman's rude new  assistant manager, a reporter digging up history on Bates and a  group of partying co-eds (no 80's horror movie would be complete  without them). As with any horror movie series, the PSYCHO films  have outlived their usefulness. There's only so long we can watch a  man dress up as his mother and carve people up with a butcher knife  before we get bored. PSYCHO IV: THE BEGINNING (1990) **1/2         This one, a low-budget made-for-TV effort, is actually an  improvement over the strictly blood-and-guts mentality of the third  movie. Part IV provides an origin for Norman Bates (Anthony  Perkins), with most of the movie centered around Bates' call to a  radio talk show (yes, there still is such a thing as a radio show), the  subject, of course, being men who have killed their mothers (and,  naturally, bad sequels to classic movies).         Through flashbacks we learn Norman's mother was kind of  weird, not to mention overbearing, with little Norman. Though the  relationship was never sexual (There is a part where Mrs. Bates  makes Norman take off his clothes and get in bed with her... but that  doesn't mean anything), there was an abnormal level of affection  with those two, so when Mother brings home a boyfriend and heads  straight for the motel room with the peephole, young Norman  decides something has to be done -- and fast.         Hey there, Norm, you can't solve all of life's problems with  sharp knives. There are also machine guns and hand grenades to  think about.
