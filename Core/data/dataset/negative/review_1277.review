Before 1995's `Mortal Kombat', the selection of films based on video and  computer games had been an extremely deplorable one, with only the  woeful likes of `Super Mario Bros.' (1993), `Street Fighter' (1994) and  `Double Dragon' (1994) on offer. But `Mortal Kombat' succeeded in  contradicting the trend to become an unabashedly, unpretentiously  enjoyable all-out action vehicle. And it did so by dint of the single  blindingly obvious thing that these other videogame adaptions somehow  neglected - it approximated the very style of the videogame itself by  offering up wall-to-wall action, all run over by a pounding techno  soundtrack. Now comes this slightly lesser but no less enjoyable sequel.  Anything that remotely resembles plot has been stripped to a bare  minimum to provide the film with a series of fantastic martial arts  set-pieces that are slung together in the most directly linear  connection possible. The downside of this is that the film tends to all  blur into one single shapeless action sequence. Nevertheless it is the  sheer fantastique bravado of the fight sequences where the kombatants  battle centaurs, four-armed opponents, use razor-tipped hair-braids,  unleash ice and sonic voice blasts and launch missiles built into their  chests that gives it a uniquely watchable edge. <HR>Get Your Private, Free Email at <A HREF="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</A>
