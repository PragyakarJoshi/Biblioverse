        I had no idea what this movie was about but decided to watch  it anyway because--hey, who can resist a title like that? And it makes  you wonder what kind of woman actually has eight of those. Fine, I'm  a pervert, but what kind of a reaction does a title like OCTOPUSSY  expect to elicit?         OCTOPUSSY is one of the more absurd episodes in the  James Bond series, but then I'm pretty sure every Roger Moore effort  tips the scale of absurdness. And when the female lead is someone  named Octopussy, the absurdity springs up. The perversity seems to  spring up too, at least in a small dose, especially when Octopussy  reveals that her name was given to her by her father, who always  called her "my little Octopussy." Funny, I didn't know Jerry Lee Lewis  had a daughter.         This time, Bond is out to some some Faberge egg forgers (the  bastards!), led by Octopussy and her male partner Kamal (at least  they didn't name him Octodick). Bond meddles in Kabal's business  one time too many and ends up captive in his palace. He escapes, but  comes back a little later to get some octopussy. The two find out  afterwards that they have more in common than just compatible body  parts and, when Kabal doublecrosses her by placing the customary  atomic bomb (no Bond movie would be complete without one),  Octopussy joins Bond's side.         OCTOPUSSY has its share of good and bad scenes. Good-- the plane chase teaser, the auction scene, the train chase and the circus  scenes at the end. Bad--the other plane chase, the stuffed sheep head  dinner (which pushes the limits of good taste... Monkey brains are  okay, sheep's heads, no.) and that overlong chase through the streets of  India, culminating in one of the bad guys being impaled on a bed of  nails. "Get off my bed!" an Indian yells. A failed comic relief moment,  to say the least. Almost as bad as my Octodick joke.
