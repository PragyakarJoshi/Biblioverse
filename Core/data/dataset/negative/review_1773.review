     Nothing would suffice in making a movie about the tallest mountain on earth than by showing it in the largest format on earth, as well.      This 70mm IMAX film, which I saw on the country's largest movie screen at the new San Francisco Sony Metreon (80 feet tall, 100 feet wide), is nothing short of jaw-dropping spectacular.      While the tale of Ed Viesturs climbing Mount Everest (for the fifth time) is a good one, the story of the eight people from another party who got stuck on the summit during a fierce storm Â and died Â almost brings you to tears.  EVEREST is indeed larger than life.      Of course, this is IMAX, and you go to see the spectacle of the photography.  But remember, there's a guy carrying that enormous camera up that mountain.  And a guy with a microphone.  And a tripod.  And film.  And batteries.  The making of Everest is as phenomenal as the end product.
