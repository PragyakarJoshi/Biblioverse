     To each his own.  There are those who can be glued to their TVs watching every sports program and there are those who could not care less.  Celtic Pride is about two of the former taken to the nth degree.  Yes, it's a comedy about two basketball fans, Mike O'Hara (Daniel Stern) and his pal Jimmy Flaherty (Dan Aykroyd), both fanatics about their Boston Celtics.  Actually, the silliness that this film engages in can hardly be called "comedy" without demeaning the word.      Mike and Jimmy are a couple of crazies who are watching Lewis Scott (Daman Wayans) lead his Utah Jazz team beat the pants off the Boston Celtics in the game that will decide who is the best team in the NBA.  Before long, the series is tied at the sixth game and it looks like the Celtics are going to go down to defeat in the final game.      When Mike and Jimmy discover that the Jazz's start player is enjoying an evening at a local nightclub, the two idiots decide to get Scott drunk so he will be unable to play well the next day.  Need I say more?
