Do not get Zeram. It is a live action movie, which they turned into a anmation just recently called IRIA: Zeiram The Animation. The basic plot of the movies are the same. IRIA is a bounty hunter, with her computerised partner BOB, who is after the universes most dangerous live being, the Zeram <or Zeiram>. But in the live action, the place is on modern day Japan, where you have these 2 electricians (Japanese equivalent to the Mario Bros.) who bump into Iria, and get sent to the Zone <an alternative to demention to Modern day Japan). The 2 electricians get stuck in the zone with the Zeram, and they are fighting for their lives, while Iria is stuck in MD japan, trying to help these fool fight off the Zeram.  But in IRIA: Zeiram The Animation, it starts of on a the planet Mynse, with BOB (he is human), Glen (Iria's borther) and Fujicrow (another Bounty Hunter) doing a rescue mission on this space station where the Zeiram is making mince meat of every one and any one. Glen disappears the explosion of the space station. Afterward, Bod dies and get is conscience tranfered to a computer. And Iria is now hunting the Zeiram, or is the Zeiram hunting her? And what has happened to Glen?  Zeram is really stoopid. Gun Hed was far better. Zeram could be discribed at Mario Brothers Meets ALIEN. As where IRIA: Zeiram The Animation is alot better.
