        As Perot would say, this is just sa-a-a-a-ad. NICK OF TIME  openly rips off Hitchcock by exploiting the fact that it is filmed in  "real time" (that is, one screen minute equals one real life minute -- no  cutting to later that day or two weeks later), but it's all boring enough  that it resembles life's real time. I've already written about movies that are boring and padded and still only ninety minutes long and NICK  OF TIME is definitely one of those. It could have been an hour-long  episode of any one of the "Playhouse" shows of the 50's and 60's or  maybe a half-hour tale from the crypt today.         The film opens with a giant closeup of a clock. Get used to  that image because you'll see at least fifty others before NICK OF  TIME is over. The director constantly and needlessly shoves the  real-time thing in our faces and -- you know what? -- it isn't even  accurate. By the time the movie clock goes from 12:00 to 1:30pm,  only seventy-six minutes have passed. So much for the integrity  of "real time."         Johnny Depp plays a CPA who is unwillingly drawn into a  murder conspiracy as Christopher Walken approaches him and his  young daughter in a bus station, flashing a badge and asking in his  usual creepy tone if Depp will accompany him to his van. He does  and, once he gets there, he discovers his daughter will be held  hostage by Walken's accomplice until Depp assassinates the  governor. Any attempt to tell the police or anyone else about  his dilemma will bring instant death to his daughter.         So, for the next hour or so, Depp wanders aimlessly around  a hotel with gun in pocket, making repeated attempts to tell people  his "big problem," after which Walken will pop up and remind him  his daughter will die if he doesn't kill the governor by 1:30. Soon  enough, we discover almost everyone in the governor's administration  is in on the conspiracy, which raises an inevitable question. If people  on the inside are involved in this, why wouldn't one of them  orchestrate the murder himself instead of having Walken find  a guy off the street to kill her? I mean, if it was just Walken and  his accomplice acting out some terrorist fantasy, it would make  sense, but if the governor's own husband wants her dead, he can  find a way to do it and make it look like an accident. But then we  wouldn't have a plot, would we?         NICK OF TIME mixes a gimmick and premise that could  have worked incredibly well together and instead drives it into the  ground by showing us a lot of nothing. The whole movie is basically  Depp wandering around aimlessly with Walken in the background,  making sure he doesn't go to the police. And those closeups of the  clock get old fast. As far as the whole time metaphor goes, I'd only  suggest watching NICK OF TIME on the October night we turn our  clocks back. That way, you'll only waste half-an-hour on this lifeless  thriller instead of the full ninety minutes.
