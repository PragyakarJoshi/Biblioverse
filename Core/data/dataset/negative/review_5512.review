     We lasted forty minutes in this one.  The mood was right:  Friday afternoon in a cool theater with a big screen and fully functioning sound.  The seats were comfy, the attendance sparse, and even the floors were only slightly sticky.  Thus, we were ready and waiting to enjoy this already-acclaimed golfing comedy from writer/director Ron Shelton (WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP, BULL DURHAM).  And while the credit sequence was amusing enough-- an armadillo wandering across a Texas highway and onto a dilapidated and nearly-deserted driving range-- we just couldn't get past the absurd second scene.  Here was an intelligent woman (Rene Russo, whose character claims to be a doctor) who shows up for a golf lesson (a.) alone (b.) at night and (c.) without even flinching at the flirtatious gibberish that her instructor (Kevin Costner) starts spouting.  Huh?  We gave this so-broad-it's-not-even-funny comedy another thirty minutes and then left.  On the way out, we passed a patron who was fast asleep in his plaid shirt and yellow pants.  *He* knew that the best way to watch a boring golf game was with your eyes closed.
