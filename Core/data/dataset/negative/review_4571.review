     For those action film fans who think that Steven Seagal is indestructible, I highly recommend you see EXECUTIVE DECISION, a cheese-o-rama of an action flick that gives Seagal *seventh* billing and a quick ride to Action Hero Heaven.      No, this is *not* a "Steven Seagal Movie."  It's a "Kurt Russell Movie"--the New Kurt Russell, the tough-yet-vulnerable Kurt Russell, the Kurt Russell a la Bruce Willis-type with whom we're about to be deluged, like it or not (answer:  probably not).      The story of EXECUTIVE DECISION is easy to boil down:  another rehashing of DIE HARD, on an airplane for the first time since PASSENGER 57.  This outing, Seagal, Russell, John Leguizamo, and Oliver Platt head a team of scrappy commandos and less-warlike people who board a 747 in mid-flight to stop a nerve gas bomb from detonating over Washington and wiping out the Eastern seaboard.  This, apparently, is what terrorists do for kicks.      It could've been fun.  It's been done, yes, but a fresh take on the hostage story can be exciting, and at times, EXECUTIVE DECISION is edge-of-your-seat material.  The problem, and it shouldn't exist, is that for the entire first *hour* of this film, it is the most hideously boring, lifeless, repetitive, derivative, and pointless bit of celluloid you can imagine.  Clocking in at a whopping 2 hours, 20 minutes, this picture had *plenty* which could have been cut out but wasn't, resulting in a whole lot of catching up to do in the last hour.      Thank God that the catch-up is pretty fun--but still, putting the audience to sleep at the beginning of the movie is a violation of the cardinal rule of action filmmaking.      If you're wondering about the acting, dialogue, etc.--don't.  They're all typically cheese-infested (Seagal's character is actually, and I am not making this up, named "Austin Travis").  Instead, if you go to EXECUTIVE DECISION, sit back and try to enjoy the explosions and high-tech gadgetry.  But more importantly, try to get there late. -Christopher Null  /  <A HREF="mailto:null@utxvms.cc.utexas.edu">null@utxvms.cc.utexas.edu</A> -Screenwriter  /  Novelist  /  Publisher -Visit the Movie Emporium at <A HREF="http://cca2.carrington.com/emporium/">http://cca2.carrington.com/emporium/</A> -and e-mail requests to join the movie review mailing list
