        "Baseball is my religion," Susan Sarandon announces at the  beginning of BULL DURHAM. And apparently, her form of  communion is torrid sex with one minor league baseball player a year.  The movie follows the minor league Durham Bulls (whoever named  the movie was apparently cixelsyd... excuse me, dyslexic), more  specifically, Sarandon's two prospects for the gigolo position. The first  prospect is young Tim Robbins, the impulsive pitcher who "f*cks like  he pitches." (At 95 miles an hour?) The other prospect is aging catcher  Kevin Costner, who has been busted down to A-ball from the big  leagues.         Touch choice, eh? The elimination round comes as  Sarandon invites them both back to her place -- and wouldn't  _that_ be the threesome from hell! Costner storms out after learning what the arrangement is all about, leaving Sarandon to tie Robbins to  her bed and read poetry to him all night. You see, it's not all sex, she  also teaches her young charges the rules and secrets of life. They  acquire the essential knowledge of life through wild, animal sex,  which leads to the obvious question -- why don't the state  universities offer this kind of program?!         Costner is assigned by the team manager to do much the  same thing with Robbins in a non-sexual way. So, over the course of  the movie, Robbins hones his talent into major league-quality pitching  with advice from Costner and Sarandon. According to BULL  DURHAM, the way to succeed in baseball is to wear garter belts under  your uniform and learn to breathe through your eyelids like the Mayan  Indians. You didn't hear it from me, but that's also the key to  succeeding in the movie-reviewing business.         BULL DURHAM has an intriguing premise, mixing  America's two favorite pastimes, and follows through with it for the  first half of the movie, but gets off track around the five-inning mark,  when Robbins gets on a winning streak and decided to quit slipping  Sarandon the screwball every night, a duty we all know Costner will  take up sooner or later. He does, of course, in a sex scene none of us  ever wanted to see. Still, the film has its moments, comedic and  dramatic, and is worth watching for its big-league talent. No  rookies here, baby.
