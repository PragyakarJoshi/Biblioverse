          It is not bad enough that our schools are in bad shape. It is not bad enough that illiteracy in the United States is so high. What we do not need is a movie that lays it on in thick globs that demean everyone.  In addition it is a boring film.          I never liked Jon Lovitz whom I compare to Chevy Chase.  Both have sneers that turn me off.  Lovitz, in addition, affects a dumb look as his idea of being a comic.  In HIGH SCHOOL HIGH, he is a teacher at a private school who opts to leave in order to teach at an inner city school.  There he encounters every kind of mischief and worse.  There he finds a principal (Louise Fletcher) who uses a baseball bat to keep the "students" in line.   That this is the same Fletcher who was so good in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, is hard to believe. . . and it is very sad that she cannot get a better role.          I would have liked to review more of the film but after one half hour of this disgusting display I left.  It has been several years since I walked out before a screening was over but that happened twice in this one week.   Baaaad.           This was supposed to be a NAKED GUN type of movie, or AIRPLANE, but it fell flat on its face because it lacked the wit that the other films had.
