        It's all been downhill for Eddie Murphy these past eight  or nine years career-wise, and he's still trying to make a crowd- pleasing blockbuster to relaunch his 80's stardom. If the crowd I  was with is any indication, Murphy has succeeded. God only knows  if the rest of the country's audiences will feel the same way, but the  packed mall crowd I saw THE NUTTY PROFESSOR with laughed  so hard at the surface-level gags that I missed half the dialogue.         What do you say about a movie like this, where fart  jokes abound and the word "ass" is used every couple minutes  for laughter? That it's the kind of movie most of us could write in  our sleep if given the premise, a lightweight and predictable comedy  that the brainless masses laugh out loud at over and over. I'd almost  have to lump myself in with the "brainless masses" demographic  because I succumbed to a lot of the cheap laughs in THE NUTTY  PROFESSOR, although not loud or long enough to drown out any  dialogue.         Murphy plays Sherman Klump, a four-hundred pound  college professor who has stumbled onto a formula that will change  his molecular structure and turn him into a slim love god. So after  the customary fat person sight gags (Murphy's stomach erasing  the chalkboard as he writes, Murphy trying to sit in a chair, etc.)  and the introduction of the love interest, a beautiful grad student  (Jada Pinkett, looking ten times better here than in A LOW DOWN  DIRTY SHAME), Murphy drinks his potion and reaps the immediate  benefits ("I can see my dick!").         I'm sure you've heard the expression that inside every  fat person there's a skinny person waiting to get out. THE NUTTY  PROFESSOR assumes that skinny person is a completely different  alter-ego from the person's usual personality. At his correct body  weight, Murphy becomes Buddy Love, a brash, over-confident  loudmouth with sex on his mind. High testosterone levels are an  apparent side effect of taking the potion, causing Murphy to act  on his feelings for Pinkett.         This being a cut-rate sitcom, of course, he doesn't tell  her that Love and Klump are one and the same, he pulls the old  Clark Kent-Superman thing, having her know both personalities  and having them talk about each other but never interact. And  Pinkett doesn't have a clue as to what is going on because Murphy's  voice is completely different as Love than Klump. His Love voice is  much higher-pitched than Klump, making me wonder if we're  supposed to think his voice lost weight too. Either way, the voice  mystery is never explained, but you're probably not supposed to  stop and think about any of this.         As another sitcom gimmick, Murphy's potion wears off  after a certain amount of time, and always in the exact wrong place  at the wrong time. That way people can stare as his lip suddenly  swells to several times its size or his foot becomes twice as big  because, besides being Murphy's comeback vehicle, THE NUTTY  PROFESSOR also showcases some admirable special effects from  Tom Baker, the man who turned Michael Jackson into a freak in  the Thriller video (which took a lot of effort, believe me). But while  Murphy was sitting in that makeup chair for five hours everyday,  someone else should have been working on creating a decent,  cliche-free script.         The movie continues with Pinkett trying to choose  between Klump and Love, along with Klump having to pitch his  idea to millionaire donor James Coburn (also in ERASER). We  also get a couple of extended flatulence scenes with the Klump  family, where Murphy plays five different overweight roles, and  some TV inspiration from a Richard Simmons exercise clone  (Murphy again).         The ending is as absurd and unbelievable as the rest  and contradicts the movie's entire premise (that fat people would  do anything to achieve an effortless weight loss), but if you can  overlook all of that and just let yourself enjoy the decent amount  of genuine laughs mixed in with the cheap ones, you might have  a positive (but probably not nutty) experience with THE NUTTY  PROFESSOR.
