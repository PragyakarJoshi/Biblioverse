Cast: David Schwimmer, Jason Lee, Mili Avital, Bonnie Hunt, Vanessa Angel, Kari Wuhrer Director: Doug Ellin Producers: Andrew Form, Rick Lashbrook, Tag Mendillo Screenplay: James Frey and Doug Ellin Another day, another poorly made David Schwimmer movie. He ends up making a fool of himself, but that's becoming a usual trend in his movies. If you're the kind of person who likes David Schwimmer in FRIENDS or who appreciated his performance in THE PALLBEARER, then you may be able to tolerate this movie. Since I am neither, I will stand back and be totally biased and say this was an awful movie. Ever notice that David Schwimmer always carries the same persona in all his acting roles. He just can't seem to get out of that annoying puppy dog look, feel sorry for me, Â duh Â droll-sort-of-voice which makes many women fall for him??? He's the kind of actor, that women probably like to mother in real life, but has drawbacks in limiting your choice of movie roles after awhile. Anyway enough about Schwimmer, before my blood pressure soars through the roof. Let's just say that KISSING A FOOL is marginally better than most of his co-star FRIENDS-Hollywood-efforts, but that doesn't really say much considering their poor track record. The plot basically involves two best friends, Max Abbit (Schwimmer) and Jay Murphy (Jason Lee) and how they end up falling in love with the same woma, Samantha Andrews (Mili Avital). The story is told through the lips of the ever-charming Bonnie Hunt, and the idea is to semi-guess what happened and who ends up with whom in the end. It's all very predictable, but I'm not sure how many guys will really appreciate their best-friends ex-girlfriends after knowing how intimate they were in bed? Can you still be best friends after this? In Hollywood you can, and with a tremendous about of forgiving, forgetting and reading Â all ends up well in the rather foolish world of David Schwimmer.
