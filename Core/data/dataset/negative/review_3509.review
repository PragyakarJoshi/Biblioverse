     Is there a law that says the road workers can only work on nice smooth surface?  I mean every time they repave a road, they immediately dig it up and do some stuff on it.  After which, you have an uneven road with bunch of patches on it.  And if they come around to repave the road again (after forever and few alignment adjustments), the whole series of road work begins again (so you can never have a nice road).      Speaking of missed cues, FRENCH KISS came out so I had to go check it out.  It's about this woman who got dumped by her fiancee while he went on a business trip to Paris.  And she's determined to get this looser back for some reason.  Ahh, women -- I'll never understand their reasonings.      No nakkid boobs.  No bullets.  No dead bodies.  2 on the vomit meter.  No moon shots.  What we got here are: airplane-fu, old folk's home-fu, attack of killer telephone call-fu, little booze-fu, tourist-fu, goddess-fu, attack of killer train food-fu, wine-fu and of course a plant-fu.  Drive-in academy nomination for saying stuff like "All men are bastards" and to Kevin Klein for saying stuff like "What can I say?  I'm an asshole."  And to Jean from Professional for saying stuff like "I owe him more than mere money".  One and a three quarters star.  Shaggy Bob says check it out!      Alien Alert!  Did ya hear about this woman accusing a Santa Clara Deputy for raping her in a courthouse?  Apparently this occurred during the middle of a day in a busy courthouse.  Hmmm.  Either way, we got some sickos out there.
