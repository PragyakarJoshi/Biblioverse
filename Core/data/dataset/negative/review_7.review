     LETHAL WEAPON is a light-weight action thriller that quickly degenerates to an extremely stupid movie.      While a detective whose name I don't remember is investigating the murder of a friend's daughter, he and his new partner, Riggs, a suicidal burned-out ex-Vietnam sniper, stumble onto a heroin ring.      This movie is so loaded with cliches, ex-CIA men turned to crime, a tough looking guy holding his arm in a flame to prove his loyalty to Fearless Leader, kidnapped daughters, and so on, that there is no room left for any genuine suspense.  What is left is an adventure movie with no guts or heart.      If you look hard for something worthwhile in this movie, there is a vague chemistry between Glover and Gibson that provides a couple of good laughs.  But that chemistry is erratic at best, and doesn't come close to saving the film.
