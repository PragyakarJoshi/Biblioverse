ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE (1969) **         In between YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and DIAMONDS  ARE FOREVER was this odd little James Bond film.. I shouldn't call  it a little film; it's 140-minute running time is the longest of the Bond  series. It's also the only one to star George Lazenby (Never heard of  him? Neither have I.) as 007. Being sandwiched between two Sean  Connery movies makes this one look that much more amateurish in  comparison.         The epic running time is absolutely unnecessary, as the real  story doesn't begin for an hour and a half, by which time most other  movies would be almost over. That first 90 minutes gives us a lot of  expository information with little action, save the traditional opening  teaser, and that's not even up to par with the other movies in the series.         Bond is still after Blofeld (who first popped in YOLT and  again in DAF and is now played by Telly "Kojak" Savales) here, but  tired enough of chasing him to take a two-week leave of absence from  the service. That's when he meets Tracy (Diana Rigg, a.k.a. Emma  Peel of "The Avengers"), the first woman he truly falls in love with. (I  guess 700 really is his lucky number.) And certainly his plans for  marriage don't have anything to do with the fact that Tracy's father, a  crime boss, offered valuable information about Blofeld's whereabouts if  Bond would marry his daughter.         So Bond rushes off to Blofeld's mountain hideout, populated  by a bevy of beauties who think he's curing them of their allergies,  when he's really grooming them to destroy Western civilization as we  know it. (Talk about your unconventional therapy techniques!) Bond  meets his three-woman quota there before Blofeld discovers that he's  not really a genealogist on research. The usual death traps and chases  ensue, including a ski run chase that would be redone and improved  upon in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME.         ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE has a little merit.  The story is decent, albeit way too overblown and long-winded, but  adding the romance aspect to the Bond series was a good idea, even if  they did have to add the obligatory young-couple-in-love song  montage. And there is a truly touching moment at the end of the  movie. But on the whole, this movie is to be viewed only by the Bond  fan who absolutely has to see every movie in the series. Otherwise, just  skip right over it and you won't miss a thing.         OHMSS has far less action than the others and George  Lazenby doesn't quite cut the mustard as James Bond. (He does cut the  cheese a few times, to the disgust of the other characters.) Rolling  Stone called Lazenby "a one-shot joke" and I have to agree. The  Rolling Stones called him "Jumpin' Jack Flash" and I have to say I  have no idea what that means.
