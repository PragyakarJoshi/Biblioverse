        The original title of this one was ATTACK OF THE HORNY  SUPERMODEL FROM BEYOND, but the director changed it to  SPECIES when he realized a title like that would doom the film to  years of USA Up All Nite airings. Still, the horny alien supermodel is  the main attraction of the movie, despite the top-billing of  SCHINDLER'S LIST star Ben Kingsley. It's probably the only time in  film history that bad science fiction has been given the Oscar-quality  treatment. Of course, in movies of this genre, good acting is the last  thing we want or expect. We need the bad acting as much as the  obligatory shots of slimy, pulsing cocoons and drawn-out climaxes in  the sewer, both of which are featured in SPECIES.         The acting, in fact, seems to be the only part of the movie that  makes it seem like an actual movie, not just some showcase for cheesy  effects and a foreign model to take her top off at the drop of a  spacecraft. Natasha Henstridge makes her movie debut as half- supermodel, half-alien. She escapes government surveillance to begin  a cross-country flesh rampage in an attempt to breed. Yes, she's  horny--and dangerous. Called in by the government to hunt her down  are a couple scientists, a hitman (Michael Madsen) and a guy with  some unspecified psychic power (Forest Whitaker). Good idea. Read  her palm to death.         Although the plot dictates that Henstridge be naked half the  time in her ongoing attempts to conceive a child, most of the time her  pods (so to speak) are strategically covered, so don't rent the movie if  all you want is a peek of flesh. Besides that, there's a certain degree of  repulsion when Henstridge changes back and forth between  supermodel and grotesque alien. Thankfully, all the nude scenes are of  the model and not the alien, though some science-fiction nerds would  undoubtedly be turned on by the nude alien as well.         SPECIES is for the most part entertaining, if you overlook  some of the ridiculous plot points and ineffective scenes of  manufactured tension (i.e. the one where the two scientists are locked  in the lab room with the growing alien). The climax scene is boring  and unoriginal, but the rest of the movie is interesting and made  watchable by the performances from Kingsley, Whitaker and the rest,  including beautiful yet mostly silent Henstridge. And those gratuitous  pod shots don't hurt either. Visit the Movie Critic at LARGE website at <A HREF="http://www.missouri.edu/~c667778/movies.html">http://www.missouri.edu/~c667778/movies.html</A>
