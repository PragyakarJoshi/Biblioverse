        Most people should be able to find better things to do than  spend two hours hearing 80-year-old hemorrhoid sufferers yell "Eat  my shorts!" at each other. That's pretty much the maturity level of  this movie. After all, what could you expect Walter Matthau to  follow DENNIS THE MENACE with? The sad part is, though, I  actually found a lot of this amusing.         GRUMPY OLD MEN consists of Walter and Jack Lemmon  hurling childish insults at each other and pulling equally childish  pranks. Over the course of your two lucky hours watching this  movie (which hopefully you didn't pay $7.50 to see), you'll see  Matthau sink Lemmon's icehouse, Lemmon put a fish in Matthau's  car, Matthau arrange for a giant mound of snow to fall on Lemmon's  head, Lemmon cancel Matthau's social security, etc. This movie  may make the nation's opinion of the elderly fall even lower than  the Medic Alert commercial ("I've fallen... and I can't get up!")  did.         Then, midway through the movie, the plot shifts as  Lemmon and Matthau make a bet on which one can bed Ann  Margret first. That's got to be more than any sane individual can  take. But if you stick around for the closing credits, you'll hear a  90-year-old Burgess Meredith's colorful euphimisms for sex. Oh,  great. Nothing seems more funny to me than the "horny old man"  stereotype saying things like, "Looks like he's about to take the  skin boat to tuna town." Maybe euthanasia's not as cruel as we  thought...
