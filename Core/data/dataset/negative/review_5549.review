There I was, chillin' as usual and what do I see on the bus?  I see this woman who wanted to get off but didn't know that she was supposed to step down into the stairwell so she yells "back door" to the driver.  And another girl yells "step down."  Of course the woman gets to get off without further incidence but the girl says "I guess people don't read the signs" while eating sunflower seeds right under the no food sign.  Since when did we start accepting hypocrites as a daily norm? Speaking of counter productive behavior, ISLAND OF DR MOREAU came out and I had to go check it out.  It's about this doctor who's doing this genetic research in a secluded island in south Pacific and the inhabitants he made.  Of course something goes wrong for the plot to develop.  And yes, there is one survivor who's going to be able to tell the tale for others. 1 mammary scene.  9 dead bodies.  2 doz bullets.  38 on the vomit meter.  No moon shots.  What we got here are:  more counter productive behavior on the raft-fu, attack of killer shark-fu, search and rescue party-fu, IV-fu, a shot from hell-fu, rabbits-fu, dancing in the rain-fu, attack of killer flower child-fu, locking door-fu, piano concert-fu, and of course cat chase-fu.  Video hall of fame nominations to David Thewlis for saying stuff like "I'll be back" and to Fairuza Balk for saying stuff like "I'm reverting."  Of course to Marlon Brando for saying stuff like "I am closer than you can possibly imagine" and to Val Kilmer for saying stuff like "You'll like it, well, I like it."  One and a half star.  Shaggy Bob says wicked! Spoiler - Stories based on Victorian era science may have a tendency to not to follow the science practiced today but they usually have a really good idea.  And this one is of no exception.  The problem is, that was all they had.  Ok, the make up for the animal people were cool but how far can make up take you?  No plot gets in the way of the story line.  And you certainly aren't going to sympathize with any of the characters unless you're one of those animal rights activist who's bordering on insanity. If you're waiting for a call from Jenny McCarthy, stand by the phone.  You ain't gonna miss much.  And if she does call, don't take her to this flick. Alien Alert!  Bill signed the welfare reform bill which Bob said it was Republican idea.  My question is, what's going to happen in 2 years?  Better yet, what's going to happen in 5 years when people can't get more aid?  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for abolishing welfare but it would be irrisponsible to take away people's dependancy without replacing it with something so that they won't revert back to the cycle of handouts.  I bet you in 5 years that both parties are going to blame each other for the mess they created which the librals are going to blow it out of proportion. For wisdom according to Shaggy Bob, hit that Reply key now.
