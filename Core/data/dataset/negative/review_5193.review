ERASER is this summer's entry from Arnie, and it delivers just what you would expect:  good action, good effects, passable story.  There's nothing remarkable here, and none of the charm of TRUE LIES, but if you like Arnie, it's a good romp through summer movie madness.  A solid 0 on the -4/+4. This time around, Arnie plays a US Marshall working in the Witness Protection program.  His specialty is making it look like federal witnesses have been killed. The plot thicks when Venessa Williams, playing a Jr. Executive for a defense contractor that is selling weapons to the highest bidder, becomes the target of just about every living person in the Washington DC area. There are no suprises here, and the identities of the bad guys are obvious, but not obnoxiously so.  The characters are at least interesting (I mean the OTHER characters, of course.  Arnie's just playing good-guy Terminator.)  James Caan plays off Arnie well as his boss and Vanessa Williams manages not to fall into the helplessly stupid female her character could have easily been. There are some nice effects, although there is a strangely poor fire effect toward the end of the movie where the flames look like they were animated in. In short:  If you're an Arnie fan, go ahead and give it a go, otherwise you might want to pass and wait for INDEPENDENCE DAY.
