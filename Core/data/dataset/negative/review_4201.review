     It appears that Mel Brooks ought to retire from his long and successful career as both actor and director.  His last films, LIFE STINKS and DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT are sooo bad, it's pitiful.  I would like to remember him for the great laughs he gave us over a long career rather than for the ridiculous one note films he has been turning out these past few years.  Mel, quit while you are still ahead.      In LIFE STINKS the whole story revolved around a very wealthy man who gave up his all for one month to prove he could survive in the sordid world.  In DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT, Dracula is a bumbling idiot whose every scheme fails miserably.      Satire is the most difficult form of comedy to write and perform.  It's either brilliant or falls flat on its face.  This one is not in the brilliant class despite heroic "shtick" by Leslie Nelson as Dracula and Amy Yasbeck as the undersexed woman he tries to seduce. Another "vampirette" is Lysette Anthony.      Peter MacNicol is a groveling slave (remember Mel kissing the boots of his lord and master in the wonderful 12 CHAIRS?) and Mel himself plays a "vampireologist."   With the exception of 2 gags that ARE funny, the remainder is an awful bore.  Mel: quit.
