I did exactly what the title suggests when this film ended, but for a good  reason.  Is it me, or is the "disk" plot getting extremely tiresome?  I  literally shook my head when the story turned out to be just like the dreary  disk-chasing story lines of "Eraser" and "Mission:Impossible."  When disks are  brought into the picture, it's useless to chase someone that can just copy a  1.4 meg floppy in seconds or send it out to thousands of internet users' E-mail  boxes....don't you think?  It's not the 80's anymore, and this plot needs to  die with the decade.  Period.  The movie actually had potential, and Baldwin  was entertaining, but the script should have been modified for 1996.  I thought  at first that it may have been a cheap "Fugitive" rip-off, but Baldwin's  character made a comment about Harrison Ford's escape tactics in the film, and  that was humorous enough to end that idea.  The action sequences were awesome,  especially the motorcycle chase scene during the climax of the film.  These I  enjoyed, and most of the acting as well.  The theory that the action takes over  when the plot lacks, ie Twister, couldn't be applied here because it wasn't  fast enough to be a summer blockbuster, and the plot was a typical disk-chasing shoot-em-up.  Hollywood: out with the old writers and in  with the new generation...and I'll be the first to volunteer.  The story  follows a fugitive, Baldwin, that hacked into and transferred money from a  company which turns out to be the Cuban mafia.  He transfers vital data onto a  floppy, which becomes the hot item needed to nail the head of the  company with all the necessary charges.  After all the testimony hopefuls  against the head of the mafia are killed, a fake chance for an escape is setup  in order to get Baldwin to run....while he is cuffed to another person,  Fishburne, he thinks is a fellow fugitive.  This is all in hopes that Baldwin  will take them to the last alternative, the disk, which he has left with a  friend.  The rest is predictable.  For myself, it  was worth seeing this for  Salma Hayek alone.  Other than that, wait the storm out.  There will be plenty  of clear skies for the drive to the video store.
