     A young girl is murdered in the Florida Everglades and the police force the confession of the man they think who did it.  Eight years later, Harvard professor Paul Armstrong (Sean Connery) must find the truth behind the killing and set an innocent man free.      With its weak script by Jeb Stuart and Peter Stone and Arne Glimcher's uninspired direction, JUST CAUSE just barely manages to be entertaining and it is due solely to the strength of its cast.  Dealt a bland character, Connery is only able to peak our interest in Armstrong because of his potent star-persona.  Laurence Fishburne also does his best portraying the unorthodox cop, Tanny Brown, but poor writing undermines him.  Ed Harris has the film's plumb role as the psychotic Blair Sullivan, a poor man's Hannibal Lecter but in this film, we'll take what we can get.  Blair Underwood is positively boring as the innocent man accused and Kate Capshaw is downright bad as Armstrong's wife.      With the help of its Florida location and some alligators,  JUST CAUSE has a few thrills sprinkled throughout its one hour forty-two minute running time but it is hardly enough to make up the slow pace and gaping plot-holes.  This one is a rental.
