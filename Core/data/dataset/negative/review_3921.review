Starring : Sylvester Stallone, Antonio Banderas, Julian Moore Directed by : Richard Donner Running Time : 2hrs      Team up the Italian Stallion with The Spanish El-Mariachi into one film and call up Richard (LETHAL WEAPON 1,2 & 3, MAVERICK) Donner to direct it, looks like a sure hit right?  Wrong!  This the second movie for Stallone this summer (he reportedly got paid US$50 million to do three movies this year) and the second bomb for him this year after the dismal response for the high budget sci-fi flick, JUDGE DREDD.  While, Sly's career seems to be going downhill, his Spanish counterpart (who can actually speak better than him!) is on his way up.  Banderas also starred in DESPERADO, a high octaned action film with the bodycount higher than all the RAMBO movies put together, which incidentally may not pass the censors here, I hope not!!      Stallone is Robert Rath, the best hired gun money can buy.  He's been on the business for many years and can be considered a veteran of that trade.  From the starting sequences, we see that Rath is getting tired (bored?) and seemingly a little frustrated about the direction of his life, retirement is on his mind, but its not exactly one job one can just quit so easily.  His life was immediately made more interesting with the appearance of Miguel Bain (Antonio Banderas), a psychotic, semi-lunatic hired gun, who `steals' Rath's contracts by killing the targets before he can get to them, in the beginning we are made to think that Miguel is just some crazy hired-gun who is trying very hard to be oust Rath and be no.1 in the trade but as the story unfolds, a greater plot ensues.      The love interest, (I shall call her Cat, couldn't catch the name) played by Julian Moore, a small time hacker with no real identity and gets entangled in something much more than she would ever imagine.  Cat started out being the prime target of a hit but ended up being saved by Rath from Miguel.  For once, there's a decent plot in a Stallone movie and although slightly predictable, is quite interesting + enjoyable.      Stallone fares well here, partly due to the fact that he speaks very much less than most of his other movies.  Banderas's Miguel was totally cool ... toting around town in in his sweaty, psychotic-appearance, Latino looks and a "Speedy Gonzales" accent, his character easily outshines Stallone's Rath.  Is this a precedence in action movies today?  Most baddies seem to take the front seat from the hero.      All in all, there's a lot of creative shoot-outs in this film (very John Woo, but on a more believable level), enough explosives and suspense to satisfy most action lovers.  But there are time when the action tries a bit too hard, only to end up being totally boring and predictable.  Richard Donner is an exceptional action film director and it is sad to see his film not doing well, maybe he should team up with Gibson again in another LETHAL WEAPON movie, I'll like that.  If you're an action fan, this film should prove to be quite enjoyable, Banderas is pure fun to watch.
