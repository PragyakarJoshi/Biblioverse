     The nicest thing that you can say about this movie is that it's *extremely* easy on the eyes.  Robert Redford plays a seasoned news producer, Michelle Pfieffer is his ambitious young protege, and, together, they lend a suitable star power to an otherwise lousy movie. UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL is a grand failure because it's ultimately about *nothing.* No social statement, no compelling drama, and not even a very good love story.  We're in fairy-tale land, here, where a female anchor's drive has less to do with her career than her co-dependency, and where the biggest story surprise is guessing which hideous hairdo that Pfieffer will wear next.  Ugh.      Early in the movie, Redford says of his co-star's character: "She eats the lens." This fact is also true for the actors as actors.  Sure, they're too old for their happily-ever-after roles, but R.  and M. bring an illusion of buoyancy to a steadily sinking ship.  With those two on screen, who wants to leave early-- even in the middle of a movie as meaningless as this?      Unwatchable?  No.  Awful?  Often.  The low points lay like land mines, ranging from a succession of stomach-turning love scenes to what must be at least *four* different endings.  And what's with all those early shots of Pfieffer bending over??  Somewhere in the middle of UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL-- which was based on the life and times of Jessica Savitch, until Disney got a hold of it.  Now it's merely "suggested by"-- the two travel to the Florida Keys, over the highway bridge that James Cameron destroyed in TRUE LIES.  I kept wishing for those Harrier jets to return, to blow-up the bridge that would strand them there that would stop the movie that would send us all home.  It didn't happen.
