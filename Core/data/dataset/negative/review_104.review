     It appears that here is a movie that is either embraced and loved or condemned and despised.  There is no in-between.  The critics have loved it. And most people I have talked to have despised it.  Someone posted a review here saying how much he hated it.  Two women in the theater restroom after the movie couldn't say enough bad things about it.      It would be silly of me to recommend a movie that generates such varying responses.  I liked it a lot and my husband liked it even more.  But it is a strange movie, I have to admit that.  It's funny, but not like BEVERLY HILLS COP so there isn't mass appeal.  We have Owen (Danny DeVito) who hates his mother and who is a little crazy.  And we have Larry (Billy Crystal) who is a writer who hates his ex-wife because she stole his novel.  Owen wants his mother dead; Larry wants his wife dead (or so Owen believes).  Strange things start happening and Larry gets caught up in a plot that totally throws him off balance.  The story is about Larry, and the direction helps to throw the audience off balance the way that Larry is thrown off balance.  There are interesting segues that confuse.  You don't know where you are sometimes or how you got there, or how you'll get out.      There are funny lines scattered throughout the film, but you can't depend on these for the laughs.  You have to be able to laugh at the absurdity of the whole situation, and the lunacy of the characters (particularly Owen who is really off-the-wall).  Anne Ramsey (as Momma) is totally despicable and hilarious.      I can't universally recommend this film because it depends too much on  personal taste.  This movie doesn't have mass appeal in my mind because it is so strange.  But I liked it all the same.
