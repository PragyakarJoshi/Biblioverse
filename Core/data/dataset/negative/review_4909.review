        There are only a few contemporary actors who can make fans laugh simply by appearing on screen.  These actors don't have to do anything funny; just looking at them brings on the giggles.  Woody Allen and John Cleese are prime examples, and if you ask me, so is Eric Idle, who--unlike Cleese--has been woefully underutilized by filmmakers since Monty Python disbanded.         Finally, seven years after MEANING OF LIFE, Idle has a starring role (opposite Robbie Coltrane) in NUNS ON THE RUN.  NUNS, unfortunately, is a mindless, unoriginal caper comedy, but thanks to Idle's elastic face and silly expressions, the movie is thoroughly entertaining.  We're talking dumb but fun.         Idle and Coltrane play aging crooks who are looking to go straight. As the title suggests, they end up hiding in a convent, disguised as nuns. Idle, who is no stranger to appearing in drag, brings his customary flair to the role.  Coltrane, as Idle's partner in crime, plays his part well, but he doesn't have Idle's comic pizazz.  Camille Coduri, who plays Idle's love-interest, is adorable in a Goldie Hawn sort of way.         Writer-director Jonathan Lynn throws gag after gag at the screen, and only some of them stick.  The movie's appeal derives more from the comic performances than from Lynn's uneven screenplay, which relies too much on cheap, physical humor.  NUNS ON THE RUN is no FISH CALLED WANDA, but it's nearly impossible to resist Eric Idle as a nun.
