Knock-Off (1998) - Jean-Claude Van Damme, Rob Schneider, Lela Rochon, Paul Sorvino    What do you get when you bring together sometimes-memorable action    star Jean-Claude Van Damme, former "Saturday Night Live" comic genius    Rob Schneider and the lovely Lela Rochon?    I'm not sure either, but that particular chaotic mishmash is in    theaters everywhere under the oddly appropriate title "Knock-Off."    There is something vaguely resembling a plot, but it's so convoluted    that any attempt to summarize it would only lead to even more    confusion. Schneider and Rochon are CIA agents investigating a flood    of such fine products as "Pumma" sneakers and other cheap copies, or    knock-offs.    Van Damme's character figures in there somehow, and so do the Russians    in a cliched attempted to take over the world. As this film is    nominally set in 1997, during the return of Hong Kong to China, this    is just one of many things that utterly defy logic.    Why would the CIA have people in Hong Kong, investigating a small ring    of petty thieves?    The actors certainly don't do much to make the audience care. Van    Damme seems only to be there to crack heads in, showing remarkably    little personality. Rochon is treated a bit better in her    action-intense role, but is also stifled in the acting department.    Schneider manages to show off a bit of his comic talent, whipping out    the occasional witty one-liner, but that's just not enough to save    this movie.    So we're left with gratuitous violence, and at least a noble effort is    made. Famous Hong Kong director Tsui Hark does the best with what he    has to work with, using all the tricks that made him famous -    slow-motion, stop-motion, dizzying camera angles and the occasional    blur. "Knock-Off" ends up looking like a good Hong Kong film, just    waiting for Jackie Chan or Chow Yun-Fat to show up.    They don't show up, of course. All three of the leads do their best,    and should at least be credited for the effort, no matter how far    short it may fall of the goal.    In the end, "Knock-Off" is itself just a knock-off of all the good    films you could be watching instead. Save the 5 bucks and go rent    "Hard Boiled" or most any Jackie Chan flick. That way you'll be sure    of getting the real thing.
