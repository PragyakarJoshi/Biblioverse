You thought PUPPETMASTERS was bad?  You thought FRIDAY THE 13th PART 4 was bad?  How about Alien III?  Guess again sonny-boy, you just hadn't seen  SCREAMERS yet.  How bad was it?  It was so bad, I laughed.  As a comedy,  it might have worked.  As a suspenseful sci-fi flick, it stank to the  rafters.  (-3 on +4/-4 scale). There's a decent idea buried somewhere in this movie, but it is so obscured with a laughably predictable plot, poor mattes, and dubious effects that the end result is a boring movie without even a decent amount of shock value.  Despite the theatre having the volume cranked to painful levels (especailly considereding the high pitched "scream" from the title) I found myself yawning. Within the first five minutes of the movie anyone with a still connected frontal cortex will have the entire movie mapped out.  There is no sin worse in a suspense movie than to be so predictable. Perfectly good opportunities to build supsense are wasted.  Chances to build the characters from something more than their cartoonish charicatures are squandered.  In short, the movie is a waste of time. How bad was it, really?  It was a little worse than DUMB AND DUMBER. --  Distrubution of this message by Microsoft, its subsidiaries, or its software shall constitute a violation of my copyrights.
