        I have to admit that, despite all the endless hours I've spent  watching sitcom reruns on cable, I've never seen an episode of "Sgt.  Bilko." It's probably better that I haven't, though, because I'm sure this  movie pales in comparison. Still, I've seen every episode of "Saturday  Night Live" and enjoy the work of the three "SNL" stars who carry the  SGT. BILKO movie -- Steve Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman.  It's still no guarantee that the name of those three on a movie marquee  means an entertaining film experience. I need only cite the titles A  SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE, DOCTOR DETROIT and HOW I GOT  INTO COLLEGE for evidence of that.         Martin plays the one-note Bilko character, a money-obsessed  finagler who secretly runs gambling and laundering operations on the  barracks. Aykroyd plays the one-note general character, who manages  to overlook the rampant corruption due to Bilko's profuse ass-kissing.  Hartman plays the one-note bastard character who is out for revenge  against Bilko. The plot basically has Hartman trying to trip up Bilko,  with Bilko continually outwitting him.         That includes having Bilko's platoon audited by two  accountant dorks (including fellow "SNL" alum Chris Rock), Hartman  and Aykroyd popping in for a surprise inspection at the worst possible  time, Hartman trying to romance Bilko's longsuffering fiance (Glenn  Headly) and a bunch of crap involving the $70 million hovertank the  Bilko platoon was supposed to be building. The lone voice of dissent  amidst the Bilko platoon amid all this criminal activity is a new recruit  who is actually serious about defending American liberty. Rest assured  by the end of the movie he too will abandon that antiquated notion and  begin living off government money like the rest of the platoon. Yeah, a  real happy ending.         SGT. BILKO isn't a decent comeback vehicle for Martin or  Aykroyd, who both give mediocre, walk-through performances, but at  least Hartman shows talent amid the ninety minutes of mindless  entertainment, most of which is contrived and unoriginal. The movie  does have its share of laughs, though, and is fun to watch most of the  time. Even so, I'm about ready for the Army Comedy genre to die out.  In this day and age, it comes off as lame and unnecessary, kind of like  the real Army. (No flame mail on that one, please, militarists.)
