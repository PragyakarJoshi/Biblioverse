THE MUPPET MOVIE (1979) ***1/2         This movie is everything THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS  CAROL wasn't. This one's well-written, funny and Kermit and the  others don't take a back seat to the human co-stars, even though there  are over twenty Hollywood superstars of yesterdecade thrown in. The  only reason I don't give THE MUPPET MOVIE four stars is because of  the stupid songs they sing. But the rest of the movie is great. We  actually get to find out where Kermit came from (Well, when two  frogs _really_ love each other...).         At the beginning of the movie, Kermit is sitting on a log with  his banjo, completely surrounded by water (I guess Henson had to hold  his breath for a while), singing a merry little song. He is discovered by  a big Hollywood agent (Dom Deluise--now you know why I said "big")  who just happens to be rowing by in a canoe at the time (He took a  wrong turn in Toledo) and tells Kermit he's got talent.  Kermit agrees,  and sets off on a journey to Hollywood.         Before he gets very far, he finds Fozzie "Wocka Wocka" the  Bear, a struggling nightclub comic, and the two resume travel in  Fozzie's Winnebago which he inherited from his uncle, who isn't dead,  just hibernating. They are intercepted by Colonel Sanders' evil twin,  who owns a chain of fried frog leg restaurants and wants Kermit as his  spokesfrog. Kermit will do nothing of the sort, however, and spends  the rest of the movie being pursued by the frog leg guy.         En route, he manages to pick up Miss Piggy, Rowlf the Dog,  the Electric Mayhem Band, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker as well  as running into a mad scientist (Mel Brooks) who wants Kermit's  brain, a very sarcastic waiter (Steve Martin), a used car salesman  (Milton Berle) and countless other walk-on actors.         The only thing I can't figure out was how Kermit was able to  ride a bicycle. But they say once you learn how, you'll never forget for  the rest of your life. THE GREAT MUPPET CAPER (1981) **1/2         The second muppet movie is also the second worst. It's not as  fresh or funny as THE MUPPET MOVIE (see THE MUPPETS TAKE  MANHATTAN), but it's sure a whole lot better than THE MUPPET  CHRISTMAS CAROL (see THE MUPPET MOVIE). This time, the  muppets play reporters out to get to the bottom of a jewel theft. In the  middle of all this is more lame song-and-dance numbers and guest star  cameos, most of which I didn't recognize.         My advice, stick with the original MUPPET MOVIE and the  MANHATTAN one (see THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL or THE  GREAT MUPPET CAPER). Even the reviews for those movies are  better than this one. THE MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN (1984) ***         Sue me, but I like those muppet movies (except for that stupid  Christmas one). They have a certain level of adult sophistication and  humor that goes right over the heads of the kids these movies are  targeted toward. That's why I watch these movies, you know, to  appreciate the sophisticated adult humor rather than the surface level  gags and songs. Yeah right. And I read Playboy for the articles.         Anyway, this time Kermit and the gang are off to new York  to try to get their little musical on Broadway. They soon discover  Times Square patrons aren't really that interested in fully-clothed  singing animals. So while Kermit tries to find a play producer who  will put them on Broadway, the Muppets all have to get jobs in New  York. I tell you, the things those muppets will do for money. I found  the Miss Piggy topless bar scene to be quite interesting. THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL (1992) *1/2         Oh boy, talk about your major disappointments. When I see  the word "muppet" in the title, I expect something major, but it seems  that since Jim Henson... uh... passed on, those muppets just aren't the  same. In their fourth movie, they try to do a muppet version of that  Dickensian tale of Ebeneazer and the three ghosts... or was it seven  dwarfs?         Anyway, Disney did it much better when Mickey was playing  Bob Crachit and Uncle Scrooge was playing (guess who) Scrooge. In  the muppet version, Michael Caine plays Scrooge and Kermit the frog  plays Crachit. The main problem with this movie, besides the bad  writing (No offense, Dickens), is that the story is about Scrooge and  the muppets are just in the background. Kermit's only got a supporting  role this time and he wasn't too happy about it. I hear he turned green.         And, as in any movie rated G, the characters break into song  at the drop of a puppet. Even Scrooge sings! I find it hard to believe  the people in movies that sing just make up the words and elaborate  staging on the spot and that the background music comes from  nowhere yet is everywhere, like they'd like us to believe. And I suspect  the muppets don't do their own stunts either.         I think Jim Henson just turned over in his grave. I mean, the  jokes inside Bazooka bubble gum wrappers are funnier than this! So,  to sum up: Muppets--good, Michael Caine--okay, Songs--bad,  Jokes--worse, Jim Henson--dead. No snide comments, please. I wrote those when I was fifteen years old.
