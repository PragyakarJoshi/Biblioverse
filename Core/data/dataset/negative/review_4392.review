(Columbia) Directed by    Brian Gibson Written by     Ted Tally, based on the book by George Dawes Green Cast           Demi Moore, Alec Baldwin MPAA Rating    "R" (presumably for violence, language, and badly                     acted Italian mobsters) Running Time   ~120 minutes Reviewed at    General Cinemas at Pleasant Valley, Raleigh, NC (31JAN96)       At last!  A movie that explains the O.J. verdict!  Well-endowed literary revisionist Demi Moore stars in this thrill-less thriller, about a juror-in-jeopardy who must convince her peers to acquit a mobster, or else whispering bad guy Alec Baldwin will do something scary to her son.  (Such as, say, forcing him to watch Mom strip on a late-night television talk show?) Bad bad bad.  There's a fundamental wrongness to THE JUROR that almost defies explanation.  Every possible dramatic convention is ignored; every on-screen action has no meaning other than as an absurd, immediate gratification.  Even the camp value is minimal.  The first unwatchable movie of the year and, yet, people were clapping and cheering to the end.  I can't explain it.  Perhaps, after viewing Demi's various tight-fitting tops, they had formed the opinion that, for certain figures, Moore is better.  -- Mike Legeros - Raleigh, NC  <A HREF="mailto:legeros@nando.net">legeros@nando.net</A> (h) - <A HREF="mailto:legeros@unx.sas.com">legeros@unx.sas.com</A> (w) MOVIE HELL is on the Web!  <URL <A HREF="http://www.n-vision.com/hell/>">http://www.n-vision.com/hell/></A>
